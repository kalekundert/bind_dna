- Purify protein using MagStrep "type3" XT beads:

  - For each sample, transfer 20 µL well-suspended 
    5% bead solution (1 µL beads) to a clean tube.
  - Wash the beads 2x with 200 µL wash buffer [1].

  - Add protein sample to washed beads.
  - Incubate on ice for 30 min.  Flick to mix every 
    few minutes.

  - Separate beads and discard supernatant.
  - Wash 3x with 100 µL wash buffer [1].
  - Add 25 µL elution buffer [1].
  - Incubate 10 min.
  - Separate beads and collect eluate.

Footnotes:

[1] Wash buffer: 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0
    Elution buffer: Wash, 50 mM biotin

    Note that IBA calls for 1 mM EDTA in these 
    buffers, but I left it out because I don't want 
    it to interfere with my zinc fingers.
