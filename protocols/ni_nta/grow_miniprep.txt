- Start 1.5 mL overnight cultures from individual 
  colonies [1,2].

- Inoculate 10 mL day cultures with 500 µL 
  overnight culture.

- Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
  OD600 is 0.5-0.7 (30 min).

- Add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM.
  - Pellet 1 mL uninduced cells for SDS PAGE.  
    Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer.
    Freeze until use.

- Continue incubating for 4-5h.
  - Pellet 1 mL induced cells for SDS PAGE.
    Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer.
    Freeze until use.
