- Start 1.5 mL overnight cultures from individual 
  colonies [1].

- Inoculate 2 10 mL day cultures (+/− induction) 
  with 500 µL overnight culture.

- Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
  OD600 is 0.5-0.7 (30 min).

- Add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM in the 
  +induction cultures.

- Continue incubating for 4-5h.

- Harvest cells by centrifugation for 1 min at 
  15,000g.  Discard supernatant.
