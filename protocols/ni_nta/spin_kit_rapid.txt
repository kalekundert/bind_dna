- Purify proteins using Ni-NTA spin columns under 
  denaturing conditions [1]:

  - Resuspend each cell pellet in 400 µL buffer B.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Lyse cells by vortexing gently (avoid 
    frothing).  The solutions should become 
    translucent.

  - Centrifuge the lysates for 20-30 min at 
    15,000g.
    - Discard pellet.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.

  - Equilibrate a Ni-NTA spin column for each 
    sample with 600 µL buffer B.
  - Centrifuge for 2 min at 700g.

  - Load the cleared lysates.
  - Centrifuge for 2 min at 700g [2].
  - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-3x [3]:
    - Load 600 µL buffer C.
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 700g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-2x [4]:
    - Load 200 µL buffer E.
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 700g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.
    - Combine the remaining eluate.

[2] It is important not to exceed 700g when 
    centrifuging Ni-NTA Spin Columns. Higher 
    speeds reduce binding time, resulting in 
    inefficient binding.

[3] It may not be necessary to repeat the buffer C 
    wash.  The number of wash steps required to 
    obtain highly pure protein is determined 
    primarily by the expression level of the 
    His-tagged protein.  When the expression level 
    is high, two wash steps are usually sufficient 
    for removal of contaminants.  For very low 
    expression levels or highly concentrated 
    lysates, three wash steps or washes with 
    buffer D may be required to achieve high 
    purity.

[4] Most of the His-tagged protein (>80%) should 
    elute in the first 200 µL eluate, especially 
    when proteins smaller than 30 kDa are 
    purified.  The remainder will elute in the 
    second 200 µL.  If the protein should be more 
    concentrated or if the expected expression 
    level is low, elute in 100–150 µL aliquots 
    and/or do not combine eluates.
