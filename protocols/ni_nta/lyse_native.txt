- Prepare cleared E. coli lysate under native 
  conditions [1]:

  - Thaw the pellet on ice for 15 min.

    Keep the protein at 4°C for all subsequent 
    steps.  Repeated changes in temperature may be 
    harmful to protein activity and structure [2].

  - Resuspend the cell pellet in 2-5 mL lysis 
    buffer per gram wet weight [3,4].

  - Add lysozyme to 1 mg/mL.

    - Lysozyme is not stable in solution, so 
      prepare a fresh 10x solution of lysozyme in 
      lysis buffer each time.  

  - Incubate on ice for 30 min.

  - Lyse cells by sonication:

    - Keep cells on ice.
    - Repeat 6 times:
      - 10s sonication at 200-300 W
      - 10s cooling period

  - If the lysate is very viscous, apply one of 
    the following treatments:
    
    - DNase/RNase [1]:
      - Add RNase A to 10 µg/mL.
      - Add DNase I to 5 µg/mL.
      - Incubate on ice for 10-15 min.

    - Benzonase [2]:
      - Add 3U benzonase per mL culture volume.
      - Incubate on ice for 15-30 min.

    - Physical [1]:
      - Repeatedly draw sample through a 
        narrow-gauge, blunt-ended needle.

  - Centrifuge lysate at 10,000g and 4°C for 20-30 
    min.  Collect supernatant.
    - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: CL

[3] The amount of cells required depends on the 
    expression level of the 6xHis-tagged protein 
    and the expression system used.  The binding 
    capacity of Ni-NTA resins is protein-dependent 
    and normally lies between 5–10 mg/mL.

[4] Lysis buffer contains 10 mM imidazole to 
    minimize binding of untagged, contaminating 
    proteins and increase purity with fewer wash 
    steps.  If the tagged protein does not bind 
    under these conditions, the amount of 
    imidazole should be reduced to 1–5 mM.  With 
    6xHis-tagged proteins exhibiting high binding 
    affinities, the imidazole concentration can be 
    increased to 20 mM.
