- Purify proteins by "Ni-NTA miniprep" under 
  native conditions [1]:

  - Transfer 1 mL of each bacterial culture to a 
    microcentrifuge tube [2].

  - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 1 min.  Discard 
    supernatant [3].

  - Resuspend cells in 100 µL NPI-10.
  - Add lysozyme to 1 mg/mL.
  - Incubate on ice for 30 min.

  - Vortex gently to lyse cells (avoid frothing). 
  - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10 min.
    - Discard pellet.
    - Save 4 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.

  - Add 20 µL of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin to 
    each lysate.
  - Incubate at 4°C for 30 min.

  - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
    - Keep 4.83 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Discard remaining supernatant.

  - Repeat 2x:
    - Add 100 µL NPI-20.
    - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
    - Keep 4.35,4.55 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Discard remaining supernatant.

  - Repeat 3x:
    - Add 20 µL NPI-500.
    - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
    - Keep 0.95,1.00 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Collect remaining supernatant.

Notes:

[1] Protocol 14. Protein minipreps of 6xHis-tagged 
    proteins from E. coli under native conditions.  
    The QIAexpressionist (2003), pg. 85.

[2] The amount of culture used depends on the 
    protein expression level.  1 mL is sufficient 
    if the protein is expressed at high rates (see 
    Table 3, page 65). If lower expression rates 
    are expected, larger volumes may be necessary.

    If a time course of expression is being 
    performed, take 1 mL samples of a larger 
    culture at 30 min intervals after induction, 
    collect the cell pellets and store them at 
    –20°C until all the samples are ready for 
    processing.

[3] If larger culture volumes are required, refill 
    and re-centrifuge the same tube until all 
    cells are harvested.
