- Batch-purify His-tagged proteins under native 
  conditions [1]:

  - Add 1 mL 50% Ni-NTA slurry for every 4 mL 
    cleared lysate [1].

  - Incubate at 4°C for 1h with gentle shaking 
    (e.g. end-over-end mixing, or orbital mixing 
    at 200 rpm).

  - Load the lysate into a column with the bottom 
    outlet capped (e.g. BioRad Poly-Prep or 
    Econo-Pac).

  - Remove the bottom cap:
    - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: FT

  - Repeat 2x:
    - Wash with 4 mL wash buffer.
    - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: W1,W2

  - Repeat 4x:
    - Elute with 500 µL elution buffer
    - Collect in separate, clean tubes.
    - Reserve 10 µL for SDS PAGE: E1-E4
