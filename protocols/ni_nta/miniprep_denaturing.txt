- Purify proteins by "Ni-NTA miniprep" under 
  denaturing conditions [1]:

  - Transfer 1 mL of each bacterial culture to a 
    microcentrifuge tube [2].

  - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 1 min.  Discard 
    supernatants [3].

  - Resuspend cells in 200 µL buffer B.
  - Vortex gently to lyse cells (avoid frothing).  
    The solutions should become translucent [4].
  - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10 min.  Discard 
    pellet.

  - Add 50 µL of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin [5] 
    to each lysate.
  - Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.

  - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Discard remaining supernatant.

  - Repeat 2x:
    - Add 250 µL buffer C.
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Discard remaining supernatant.

  - Repeat 3x:
    - Add 25 µL buffer E.
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    - Collect remaining supernatant.

Notes:

[1] Protocol 19. 6xHis-tagged protein minipreps 
    under denaturing conditions. The 
    QIAexpressionist (2003), pg. 92.

[2] The amount of culture used depends on the 
    protein expression level.  1 mL is sufficient 
    if the protein is expressed at high rates (see 
    Table 3, page 65). If lower expression rates 
    are expected, larger volumes may be necessary.

    If a time course of expression is being 
    performed, take 1 mL samples of a larger 
    culture at 30 min intervals after induction, 
    collect the cell pellets and store them at 
    –20°C until all the samples are ready for 
    processing.

[3] If larger culture volumes are required, refill 
    and re-centrifuge the same tube until all 
    cells are harvested.

[4] Most proteins are soluble in buffer B.  If the 
    solution does not become translucent, lyse 
    cells with buffer A.

[5] 25 µL of Ni-NTA resin has a capacity for 
    125-250 µg His-tagged protein.
