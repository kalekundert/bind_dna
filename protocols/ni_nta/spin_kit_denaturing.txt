- Purify proteins using Ni-NTA spin columns under 
  denaturing conditions [1].

  - Freeze cell pellets for at least 30 min [2].
  - Thaw cell pellets for 15 min.

  - Resuspend each pellet in 700 µL buffer B [3].
  - Add 3 U/mL culture volume Benzonase.

  - Incubate at room temperature for 15 min with 
    gentle agitation.  The solutions should become 
    translucent.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Centrifuge the lysates at 12,000g for 15-30 
    min at 20-25°C.
    - Discard pellet.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.

  - Equilibrate a Ni-NTA spin column for each 
    sample with 600 µL buffer B.
  - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.

  - Load the cleared lysates.
  - Centrifuge for 2 min at 270g [4].
  - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-3x [5]:
    - Load 600 µL buffer C.
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-2x [6]:
    - Load 200 µL buffer E.
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.
    - Combine the remaining eluate.

[2] Fresh (i.e., not frozen) pellets require 
    sonication or homogenization in addition to 
    the addition of 3 U/ml culture volume 
    Benzonase nuclease and 1 mg/ml culture volume 
    lysozyme.

[3] Buffer B is the preferred lysis buffer, as the 
    cell lysate can be analyzed directly by 
    SDS-PAGE. If the cells or the protein do not 
    solubilize in Buffer B, then Buffer A must be 
    used.
    
    Since fractions which contain GuHCl will 
    precipitate with SDS when loaded onto an SDS  
    PAGE gel, they must either be diluted (1:6), 
    dialyzed, or separated from GuHCl by TCA 
    precipitation (see Appendix A, page 29).  

    Please note that Benzonase is inactive in the 
    presence of GuHCl concentrations >100 mM.  If 
    cells are lysed in GuHCl, genomic DNA must be 
    sedimented by centrifugation during collection 
    of the cleared lysate supernatant, as 
    aggregated gDNA may clog the Ni-NTA spin 
    column.

[4] To ensure efficient binding, it is important 
    not to exceed 270g when centrifuging Ni-NTA 
    spin columns.  At higher forces, even if the 
    binding kinetics are high, the time the lysate 
    is in contact with the resin is not sufficient 
    for effective binding.
    
    Please take into account that the time needed 
    for the centrifugation step during protein 
    binding is influenced by the viscosity of the 
    cleared lysate. For very concentrated cell 
    lysates, it may be necessary to extend the 
    centrifugation time to 3-4 min at 700g.

[5] It may not be necessary to repeat the buffer C 
    wash.  The number of wash steps required to 
    obtain highly pure protein is determined 
    primarily by the expression level of the 
    His-tagged protein.  When the expression level 
    is high, two wash steps are usually sufficient 
    for removal of contaminants.  For very low 
    expression levels or highly concentrated 
    lysates, three wash steps or washes with 
    buffer D may be required to achieve high 
    purity.

[6] Most of the His-tagged protein (>80%) should 
    elute in the first 200 µL eluate, especially 
    when proteins smaller than 30 kDa are 
    purified.  The remainder will elute in the 
    second 200 µL.  If the protein should be more 
    concentrated or if the expected expression 
    level is low, elute in 100–150 µL aliquots 
    and/or do not combine eluates.
