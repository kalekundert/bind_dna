- Purify proteins using Ni-NTA spin columns under 
  native conditions [1].

  - Resuspend 5 mL culture volume cell pellets in 
    630 µL NPI-10, then add:
    - 70 µL 10 mg/mL lysozyme
    - 3 U/mL culture volume Benzonase

  - Incubate on ice for 15-30 min.

  - Centrifuge lysates at 12,000g for 15-30 min at 
    4°C.
    - Discard pellet.
    - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.

  - Equilibrate a Ni-NTA spin column for each 
    sample with 600 µL NPI-10 [2].
  - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.

  - Load the cleared lysates.
  - Centrifuge for 5 min at 270g [3].
  - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-3x [4]:
    - Load 600 µL NPI-20.
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.

  - Repeat 1-2x [6]:
    - Load 300 µL NPI-500
    - Centrifuge for 2 min at 890g.
    - Keep 10 µL for SDS PAGE.
    - Combine the remaining eluate.

[2] By adding 10 mM imidazole, the binding of 
    non-tagged contaminating proteins is 
    inhibited, leading to greater purity in fewer 
    steps.  If the tagged protein does not bind  
    under these conditions the amount of  
    imidazole should be reduced to 1–5 mM.

[3] To ensure efficient binding, it is important 
    not to exceed 270g when centrifuging Ni-NTA 
    spin columns.  At higher forces, even if the 
    binding kinetics are high, the time the lysate 
    is in contact with the resin is not sufficient 
    for effective binding.
    
    Please take into account that the time needed 
    for the centrifugation step during protein 
    binding is influenced by the viscosity of the 
    cleared lysate. For very concentrated cell 
    lysates, it may be necessary to extend the 
    centrifugation time to 3-4 min at 700g.

[4] The number of wash steps required to obtain 
    highly pure protein is determined primarily by 
    the expression level of the His-tagged 
    protein.  When the expression level is high, 2 
    washes are usually sufficient for removal of 
    contaminants.  For very low expression levels 
    or highly concentrated lysates, 3 wash steps 
    may be required to achieve high purity.

[5] Most of the His-tagged protein (>80%) should 
    elute in the first 300 µL eluate.  The 
    remainder will elute in the second 300 µL.  If 
    the protein should be more concentrated or if 
    the expected expression level is low, elute in 
    100–150 µL aliquots and/or do not combine 
    eluates.
