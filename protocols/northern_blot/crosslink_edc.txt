    This protocol is intended for micro RNAs: "Cross-linking with UV is rapid, 
    inexpensive and works well for RNA >100 nt in length."

    THE EDC chemistry requires a 5' monophosphate.  If the RNA is not 5' 
    phosphorylated, it can be phosphorylated with T4 PNK.

    The enhanced detection we observed was significant for RNA molecules <40 nt 
    in length. No great enhancement was detected for larger molecules, for 
    example, miRNA precursors ∼70 nt (ref. 14). From this, we infer that the 
    enhanced detection afforded by EDC cross-linking declines as the size of 
    the RNA of interest increases. Thus, owing to its greater simplicity, UV 
    cross-linking would remain the method of choice for RNA greater than ∼70 
    nt.

    Would have to avoid using TBE gels, because Tris contains free amines (EDC 
    catalyzes the reaction between 5' phosphate and amines in the membrane).  
    Uses MOPS-NaOH electrophoresis buffer instead.

    Doesn't work as well with Hybond N+.  Works best with neutral nylon 
    membranes.
