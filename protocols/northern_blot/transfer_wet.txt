- Transfer the RNA to a membrane [1]:

  - Equilibrate the gel in 1x SSC for 15 min.

  - Soak the following materials:

    - Sponges: 1x SSC
    - 3MM Whatman paper: 20x SSC
    - HyBond N+ membrane: water until wet, then 20x SSC.

  - Assemble the transfer sandwich, being careful to 
    remove any bubbles that form:

    - Sponge
    - Whatman 3MM paper (2 sheets)
    - gel
    - HyBond N+ membrane
    - Whatman 3MM paper (2 sheets)
    - Sponge

  - Place the sandwich into the gel cassette such 
    that the membrane is nearer to the anode (red).
    
  - Fill the chamber with 1x SSC, pre-cooled to 4°C.

  - Transfer at 250 mM for 2h at 4°C, then at 350 mA 
    for a further 2h at 4°C.
