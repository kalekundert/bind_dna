Formaldehyde covalently reacts with the bases of the RNA to prevent base 
pairing.  The below protocols claim that hybridization can follow blotting, but 
I'm skeptical.  Seems like it'd be better to dissolve the RNA is urea/TBE (i.e.  
PAGE buffer) and blot it like that.

[Hodge1998] (based on HyBond N+ manual below)

- Cut the membrane to a suitable size (allow 1 cm²
  per RNA dot) and mark (with a pencil) to show 
  orientation and positions for sample loading (see 
  Note 4 ).

- Wet the membrane by laying it on the surface of 
  sterile distilled water and then wash briefly in 
  10X SSC and air-dry thoroughly.

  - The HyBond manual explicitly says that this step 
    is unnecessary.

- Thaw the RNA samples on ice and transfer 
  appropriate amounts (see Notes 5 and 6) to fresh 
  tubes, add 3 vol of RNA incubation solution [1] 
  and mix thoroughly.

- Heat the RNA samples at 65°C for 5 min to denature 
  RNA secondary structure and then cool on ice

- Add an equal volume of ice-cold 20X SSC and mix 
  thoroughly.

- Dot the RNA Solution onto the membrane in 2 μL 
  aliquots using a Gilson pipet, dry the membrane 
  between each loading. To speed up the process it 
  is possible to use a hairdryer to dry the membrane 
  between loadings.

- After loading the last sample dry the membrane and 
  crosslink the RNA to the membrane using a UV 
  crosslinker such as the Stratalinker (Stratagene, 
  La Jolla, CA) (see Note 7 ).

Notes:

[1] RNA incubation solution:

    657 µL formamide
    210 µL 37% (w/v) formaldehyde
    133 µL 10x MOPS

    MOPS buffer is used where formaldehyde is a 
    component of the incubation mixture.  Tris 
    buffers are not suitable due to the reactive 
    amine group.

- Cut the membrane

- Make grid with pencil

  - 1 cm between samples
  - Prewetting not required


- Prepare samples:

  DNA:
  - Dilute to desired conc in TE or 2x SSC

  RNA:
  - RNA
  - 2.2M formaldehyde
  - 50% formamide
  - 0.5x MOPS
  - Incubate at 55°C for 15 min

  1-2 µL is ideal for dot blotting

- Denature the sample:
  
  DNA:
  - Incubate at 95°C for 5 min, then chill on ice.  
    Spin briefly to collect sample.

  RNA:
  - Incubate at 55°C for 15 min, then chill on ice.
    Spin briefly to collect samples.
