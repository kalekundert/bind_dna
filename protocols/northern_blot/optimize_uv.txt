- Optimize UV crosslinking time [1,2]:

  - Carefully cut the membrane into identical strips 
    containing one lane each.  
    
  - Individually wrap each strip in a single layer 
    of UV-transparent plastic wrap [3].

  - Put the strips face down on a transilluminator 
    (or face up if using a handheld light source).

  - Expose individual strips to UV light for 30 
    seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 
    minutes [4].

[2] This experiment should be repeated occasionally, 
    as the energy output of a particular device may 
    change over time.

[3] This is to prevent the membrane from drying out 
    during imaging.

[4] Be sure the strips are treated exactly as they 
    will be during actual use, especially the degree 
    to which they are allowed to dry before 
    irradiation.
