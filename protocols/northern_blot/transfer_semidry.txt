- Transfer the RNA to a membrane [1]:

  - Equilibrate the gel in 1x TBE for 15 min with 
    gentle shaking.  This step is not necessary if 
    the electrophoresis buffer was 1x TBE.

  - Mark the membrane, to indicate which side the 
    samples will be on.

  - Soak the following materials in 1x TBE:

    - Whatman 3MM filter paper (6 sheets)
    - HyBond N+ membrane

  - Assemble the transfer sandwich.  Remove any 
    bubbles that form [2]:

    - filter paper (3 sheets)
    - membrane (marked side facing gel)
    - gel
    - filter paper (3 sheets)

  - Place the sandwich into a semidry transfer 
    apparatus such that the membrane is nearer to 
    the anode (red).  Drain any excess buffer.

  - Run the transfer with the following settings:

    Current: 0.5-3 mA/cmÂ²
    Voltage: 10-14 V
    Time:    30m-2h

    before adding the next may help prevent bubbles.
