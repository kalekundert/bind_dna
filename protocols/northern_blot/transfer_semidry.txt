- Transfer the RNA to a membrane [1,2]:

  - If the electrophoresis buffer was not 1x TBE:

    - Rinse the gel with water.
    - Equilibrate the gel in 1x TBE for 15 min 
      with gentle shaking.

  - Assemble the transfer sandwich:

    - Cut a HyBond N+ membrane and 6 sheets of 
      Whatman 3MM filter paper to the size of the 
      lanes of interest.

    - Soak the membrane in 1x TBE for ≈1 min.

    - Place the membrane on the gel, over the 
      lanes of interest.

    - Trim the gel to the size of the membrane.

    - Wet 3 sheets of filter paper in 1x TBE and 
      layer them on top of the membrane.

    - Flip the sandwich over and place it on the 
      anode (red) of a semidry transfer apparatus.

    - Wet 3 more sheets of filter paper in 1x TBE 
      and layer them on top of the gel.

    - Use a roller to remove bubbles.

  - Run the transfer with the following settings:

    Current: 0.5-4 mA/cm²
    Voltage: 14 V
    Time:    60 min

    before adding the next may help prevent bubbles.
