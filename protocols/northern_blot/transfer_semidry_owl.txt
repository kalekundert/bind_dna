- Transfer using an Owl semidry electroblotter [1]:

  - Equilibrate the gel in 1x TBE for 15 min with 
    gentle shaking.  This step is not necessary if 
    the electrophoresis buffer was 1x TBE.

  - Mark the membrane, to indicate which side the 
    samples will be on.

  - Soak the membrane and 6 filter pads in 1x TBE.  

  - Assemble the transfer sandwich.  The direction of 
    transfer is upwards, so make sure the membrane is 
    above the gel.  Be careful to remove any bubbles 
    that form [2]:

    - 3 filter pads
    - membrane (marked side facing gel)
    - gel
    - 3 filter pads

  - Drain any excess buffer from the blotter.

  - Lightly tighten the lid [3].

  - Run the blot with the following settings:

    Current: 0.5-3 mA/cmÂ²
    Voltage: 10-14 V
    Time:    30m-2h

[2] Pipetting a few mL of buffer onto each layer 
    before adding the next may help prevent bubbles.

[3] The weight of the lid is usually enough; the 
    screws are not required.  If you use the screws, 
    drain any excess buffer that was squeezed out.
