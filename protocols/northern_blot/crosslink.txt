- Prepare the membrane for cross-linking [1]:

  - Carefully remove the gel from the membrane
    and mark the orientation of the membrane with a 
    ballpoint ink pen.

  - Wrap the membrane in plastic wrap and place it on 
    a sheet of Whatman 3MM paper.

- Cross-link the RNA to the membrane [1]:
   
   Stratalinker:
   
   - Place the membrane in a Stratalinker with the 
     RNA surface facing up.
   - Expose it to short-wave UV light (254 nm; the 
     1200 mJ auto-cross-linking setting in a 
     Stratalinker) for 1 min.

   Transilluminator:

   - Place the membrane with the RNA surface facing 
     down against the glass.
   - Expose for the optimized amount of time, usually 
     1-5 min.
