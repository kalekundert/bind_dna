- Remove unligated linker by ultrafiltration:

  - Bring reaction to 500 µL with 8M urea.
  - Load onto a 100 kDa MWCO spin-filter [1].
  - Spin 14000g, 15 min.
  - Wash with 500 µL 8M urea.
  - Wash with 500 µL nuclease-free water.
  - Wash with water again.
  - Wash with water again [2].
  - Invert the filter into a clean tube and spin 
    1000g, 2 min to collect ligated product in a 
    volume of ≈15 µL.
