- Wrap membrane in plastic wrap
- Place directly on UV transilluminator
- Illuminate with 254 nm UV light for 2-3 min

Usually a one minute exposure with 254 nm light or three minutes with 302 nm 
light is sufficient. To ensure maximum sensitivity, however, the following 
experiment should be carried out.

Prepare a gel with five identical lanes containing 1 Âµg of RNA each. Run the gel and transfer it to the membrane.
Carefully cut the membrane into identical strips containing one lane each. Wrap these individually in a single layer of UV-transparent plastic wrap.
Put the strips face down on a transilluminator (or face up if using a handheld light source). Be sure to wear UV-opaque eyewear.
Expose individual strips to UV light for 30 seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 minutes. Be sure the strips are treated exactly as they will be during actual use, especially the degree to which they are allowed to dry before irradiation.
Probe the blot for an abundantly to moderately abundantly expressed message, according to your Northern blot protocol.
The strip having the highest intensity signal corresponds to the optimal 
exposure time for a particular membrane with a particular UV source. This 
experiment should be repeated occasionally, as the energy output of a 
particular device may change over time.
