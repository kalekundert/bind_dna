- Prepare 10 mL 2x tris-tricine SDS sample
  buffer [1,2]:

  Reagent            Stock        2x        1x
  ────────────────────────────────────────────
  water                     to 10 mL
  tris HCl                    608 mg    193 mM
  tris base                   622 mg    257 mM
  glycerol                   2400 mg       12%
  SDS                         800 mg        4%
  crystal violet  10 mg/mL    200 µL  0.1 mg/mL

  - pH=8.5

  - ≈7 mL water will be needed.  Start with
    2-3 mL to have some extra space.

  - SDS is slightly difficult to dissolve.
    Incubate at ≈60°C with stirring if necessary.

[2] Assuming glycerol is (w/v) because that's what 
    it is in the Bolt LDS recipe I got from Thermo.

[3] The Thermo recipe [1] calls only for tris HCl (no 
    tris base).  But the same recipe also calls for 
    pH=8.45, which implies that tris base is present.  

    I'm going with the latter, because it doesn't 
    really make sense to use tris HCl/base without 
    the other (the result would have no buffering 
    capacity).
    
    I don't know eactly what ratio would be necessary 
    to reach pH=8.45, so I copied the ratio from the 
    Bolt LDS buffer, which should give pH=8.5 (close 
    enough).
