- Prepare 10 mL 4x Bolt LDS sample buffer with
  crystal violet [1,2]:

  Reagent             Stock        4x         1x
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  water                      to 10 mL
  tris HCl                     666 mg     106 mM
  tris base                    682 mg     141 mM
  LDS                          800 mg         2%
  EDTA               500 mM     40 µL     0.5 mM
  glycerol                    4000 mg        10%
  crystal violet   10 mg/mL    400 µL  0.1 mg/mL

  - ≈5 mL water will be needed.  Start with 2-3 mL 
    to have some extra space.

  - LDS is slightly difficult to dissolve.  
    Incubate at ≈60°C with stirring if necessary.

  - The 1x solution should be pH=8.5.  The pH of 
    the 4x solution might be different.  Do not 
    adjust; the ratio of tris HCl:tris base will 
    give the correct pH.

Notes:

[1] Recipe from personal communication with Thermo 
    Fisher, but also listed at URL below.  Thermo 
    notes that the pH is a crucial parameter.  It 
    is quite different from the classical Laemmli 
    formulation, and allows near-neutral pH during 
    the migration in Bis-Tris gels.
