1. Desalt using Zeba 75 µL spin columns [1]:

   - Remove column's bottom enclosure and loosen 
     (but don't remove) cap.
   - Place column in clean microcentrifuge tube.
   - Spin 1000g, 1 min.
   - Discard flow-through.

   - Repeat 3x:
     - Add 50 µL water.
     - Spin 1000g, 1 min [2].
     - Discard flow-through.

   - Blot bottom of column to remove excess 
     liquid.
   - Place column in new collection tube.
   - Apply 2-12 µL sample to the resin bed [3].
   - Apply 3 µL water or buffer to the resin bed 
     after the sample has absorbed.
   - Spin 1000g, 2 min to collect desalted sample.

[2] After each spin, the resin should appear white 
    and free of liquid. If liquid is present, make 
    sure you are using the correct centrifugation 
    speed and time. Incomplete centrifugation may 
    result in poor sample recovery or sample 
    dilution.

[3] In general, reducing the sample volume added 
    to the column increases small molecule removal,
    and increasing sample volume maximizes protein 
    recovery.
