- Make 2.42x 10 µL reaction aliquots of PUREfrex 1.0 
  (GeneFrontier PF001) [1]:

  Solution I:   12.1 µL [2]
  Solution II:  1.21 µL [3]
  Solution III: 1.21 µL [3]

  - Thaw solution I at room temperature, then keep 
    on ice.  Thaw solutions II and III on ice.
  - Spin down aliquots before storing.
  - Flash-freeze and store at -80°C.

[2] Solution I may have a precipitate.  If so, 
    distribute it evenly between the aliquots by 
    vortexing and not spinning down.

[3] Solutions II and III are very viscous and 
    difficult to pipet.  Some notes:

    - Reverse pipetting doesn't work.
    - Aspiration looks accurate, but dispensing is 
      difficult.
    - Drag tip up wall of tube while dispensing to 
      get everything out.
    - Use p10.
