- Purify protein using Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads 
  (Qiagen 36111):

   - Dilute reaction to 250 μL in lysis buffer [1].
   - Add 50 μL Ni-NTA magnetic bead solution [2].
   - Mix continuously for 1h at room temperature.

   - Separate beads (1 min) and discard supernatant.
   - Wash twice with 500 µL wash buffer [1].
   - Add 25 μL elution buffer [1].
   - Incubate for 2 min.
   - Separate beads (1 min) and collect eluate.

[1] Buffers for purification in native conditions:

    TBST:    50 mM NaH₂PO₄, 300 mM NaCl,
             0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0
    Lysis:   TBST, 10 mM imidazole
    Wash:    TBST, 20 mM imidazole
    Elution: TBST, 250 mM imidazole

[2] 50 µL of beads can bind 15 µg of DHFR.  I expect 
    that PURExpress reactions produce ≈5 µg of 
    protein (based on the example yield calculation 
    NEB shows for DHFR).  20 µL of beads would be 
    sufficient for that, but I use 50 µL to be safe.
