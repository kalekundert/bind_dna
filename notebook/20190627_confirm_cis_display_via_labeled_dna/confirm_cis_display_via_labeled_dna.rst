Considerations
==============

Dyes
----
Based on the advice on `this page`__, I decided to used FAM_ and HEX_.  HEX_ 
seems better than JOE_ because its significantly cheaper and doesn't `require 
HPLC purification <https://www.idtdna.com/site/catalog/Modifications/GetAllMods#5>`_.

FAM_ https://www.idtdna.com/site/Catalog/Modifications/Product/1108
HEX_ https://www.idtdna.com/site/Catalog/Modifications/Product/1109
JOE_ https://www.idtdna.com/site/Catalog/Modifications/Product/1090

I was considering using Cy3 and Cy5, because those seem to have more separated 
spectra, but they're more expensive and FAM/HEX seem like a pretty common pair.
