1. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
   (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

2. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction by 
   mixing the following reagents at room temperature 
   in the order given.

   Reagent                   Conc  Each Rxn
   ────────────────────────────────────────
   nuclease-free water              5.50 μL
   reaction buffer            10x   2.00 μL
   RNase inhibitor        40 U/μL   0.50 μL
   rNTP mix                100 mM   8.00 μL
   HiScribe T7                10x   2.00 μL
   DNA template         500 ng/μL   2.00 μL
   ────────────────────────────────────────
                                   20.00 μL

3. Incubate at 37°C (thermocycler) for 4 hours.

4. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
   RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

5. Nanodrop to determine the RNA concentration.

6. Dilute (if desired) enough RNA to make several 
   15 μL aliquots and to run a gel.  Keep any left- 
   over RNA undiluted.  Flash-freeze in liquid N₂ and 
   store at -80°C.

7. Run the RNA on a denaturing gel to make sure it's 
   homogeneous and of the right size.
