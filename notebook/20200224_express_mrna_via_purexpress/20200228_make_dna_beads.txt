1. Setup 3 XmnI digestions:

   Reagent              Stock    Volume       3.3x
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                       39.00 µL  128.70 µL
   p49,p50,p51      200 ng/µL   5.00 µL           
   CutSmart buffer        10x   5.00 µL   16.50 µL
   XmnI [1]           20 U/µL   1.00 µL    3.30 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────
                               50.00 µL   45.00 µL/rxn

2. Incubate at 37°C for 5–15 min.

3. Purify DNA using magnetic beads [2].

   - Gently resuspend the bead solution [3].
   - Add 1 volume of bead solution to each sample.
   - Incubate 5 min at room temperature.
   - Apply magnet for >2 min and discard supernatant.
   - Wash twice:
     - Add 200 µL 70% EtOH.
     - Incubate 30 sec at room temperature.
     - Apply to magnet and discard ethanol.
   - Air-dry for 4-5 minutes [4].
   - Add 10 µL of EB.
   - Apply magnet for >2 min.
   - Transfer ≈95% of the eluant to a clean tube.

Notes:
[1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
    (10–20 units for genomic DNA) in a 1 hour digest. 
    Enzyme volume should not exceed 10% of the total 
    reaction volume to prevent star activity due to 
    excess glycerol.

[2] See "Magnetic Bead DNA Purification" in my Google 
    Drive for more details.

[3] Don't vortex; this damages the beads (somehow).

[4] Be careful not to over-dry the beads.  Over-dried
    beads will appear cracked and will be difficult 
    to resuspend.  If this happens, heat and agitate 
    for 10-15 minutes during elution to help 
    resuspend the beads and release the DNA.  An 
    alternative strategy is to add the eluant after a 
    very short drying step, then leaving the tubes 
    open for 10-15 minutes to allow the ethanol to 
    evaporate.
