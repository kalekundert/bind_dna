 1. Setup 1 XmnI digestion:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    water                       33.00 µL
    DNA              200 ng/µL  10.00 µL
    CutSmart buffer        10x   5.00 µL
    XmnI [1]           20 U/µL   2.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                50.00 µL

 2. Incubate at 37°C for 5–15 min.

 3. Purify DNA using magnetic beads [1].

    - Gently resuspend the bead solution [2].
    - Add 1 volume of bead solution to each sample.
    - Incubate 5 min at RT.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min and discard supernatant.
    - Add 200 µL 70% EtOH.
    - Incubate 30 sec at RT.
    - Apply to magnet and discard ethanol.
    - Repeat ethanol wash.
    - Air-dry for 4-5 minutes [3].
    - Add any volume of eluant.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min.
    - Transfer ≈95% of the eluant to a clean tube.

 4. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 5. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction by 
    mixing the following reagents at room temperature 
    in the order given.

    Reagent                   Conc  Each Rxn
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    nuclease-free water              5.50 μL
    reaction buffer            10x   2.00 μL
    RNase inhibitor        40 U/μL   0.50 μL
    rNTP mix                100 mM   8.00 μL
    HiScribe T7                10x   2.00 μL
    DNA template         500 ng/μL   2.00 μL
    ────────────────────────────────────────
                                    20.00 μL

 6. Incubate at 37°C (thermocycler) for 2 hours.

 7. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
    RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

 8. Nanodrop to determine the RNA concentration.

 9. Dilute (if desired) enough RNA to make several 
    15 μL aliquots and to run a gel.  Keep any left- 
    over RNA undiluted.  Flash-freeze in liquid N₂ and 
    store at -80°C.

10. Run the RNA on a denaturing gel to make sure it's 
    homogeneous and of the right size.

Notes:
[1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
    (10–20 units for genomic DNA) in a 1 hour digest. 
    Enzyme volume should not exceed 10% of the total 
    reaction volume to prevent star activity due to 
    excess glycerol.

[2] See "Magnetic Bead DNA Purification" in my Google 
    Drive for more details.

[3] Don't vortex; this damages the beads (somehow).

[4] Be careful not to over-dry the beads.  Over-dried
    beads will appear cracked and will be difficult 
    to resuspend.  If this happens, heat and agitate 
    for 10-15 minutes during elution to help 
    resuspend the beads and release the DNA.  An 
    alternative strategy is to add the eluant after a 
    very short drying step, then leaving the tubes 
    open for 10-15 minutes to allow the ethanol to 
    evaporate.
