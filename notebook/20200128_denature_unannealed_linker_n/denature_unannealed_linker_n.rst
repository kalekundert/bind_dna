Denature unannealed linker-N
****************************

I noticed in :expt:`20200127_eliminate_mrna_degradation` that a significant 
amount of linker (o93) appeared to bind the mRNA even without any of the 
ligation reagents or incubation steps.  This suggests that the two oligos 
anneal readily and are not fully denatured by the treatment prior to loading 
the gel, which consists of:

- urea loading buffer
- incubate at 70째C for 3 min

I need a way to fully denature this control, otherwise it will be impossible to 
use gel electrophoresis to monitor the ligation reaction.  Here I'm 
experimenting with ways of achieving this.

Formamide, 10 min incubation --- 2020/01/28
----------------------------------------
I'm trying a formamide loading buffer (NEB B0363) and a 10 min incubation at 
70째C.  Fitzy told me that formamide is better at denaturing RNA that urea, and 
that formamide loading buffers can be used with urea gels.  I'm also trying a 
prolonged incubation at 70째C, although 10 min at 70째C still falls within the 
range recommended by NEB.
