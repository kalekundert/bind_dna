Detect RNase H activity
***********************

2020/11/06

George hypothesized that the degradation I'm seeing in my in vitro expression 
reactions (e.g. :expt:`66`) maybe due to RNase H contamination.  To investigate 
that possibility, I want to find an assay that I can use to test specifically 
for this activity.

Note that if I do find RNase H activity, I have a few options:

- Try to inhibit it, e.g. by adding an excess of decoy substrate.
- Find a kit that doesn't have any RNase H activity, e.g. maybe PUREfrex
- Design my mRNA using splint ligation, to avoid creating a RNA/DNA duplex.

There are a number of assays that have been published, and I haven't looked at 
all of them closely.  I'm favoring assays that seem simple, cheap, and robust 
to the whatever might be present in IVTT reactions.  High sensitivity is also 
desirable, since the contaminant might be present in only small amounts.  Here 
are the assays that seem most worthwhile to me:

- [Rizzo2002]_
- [Hu2010]_
