Anneal linker to mRNA
*********************

Prior to the ligation reaction, the linker must be annealed to the mRNA.  
Presumably efficient annealing is necessary for efficient ligation.  However, 
there are many possible annealing protocols, and the protocol used by 
[Naimudden2016]_ isn't described in detail.  So here I am attempting to find a 
good protocol by experimentation.

I'm using native PAGE to measure annealing.  My thought is that one the linker 
and the mRNA are annealed, they should remain annealed during native PAGE.  
Likewise, unannealed linker/mRNA should be separated by native PAGE.  While 
this makes sense, it's just something I thought up of: not an established 
assay.  I don't really have great controls, either, so I should take the 
results with a grain of salt.
