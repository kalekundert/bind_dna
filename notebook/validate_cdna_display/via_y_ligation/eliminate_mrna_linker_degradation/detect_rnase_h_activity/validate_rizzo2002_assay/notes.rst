Validate [Rizzo2002]_ assay
***************************

Considerations
==============

Sequence
--------
[Rizzo2002]_ compares a bunch of sequence variants.  The best one is termed 
"Beacon 6":

- Shorthand: /56-FAM/rA₁₄dC₅dT₁₄/3Dab/
- Long-form: /56-FAM/rArArArArArArArArArArArArArACCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTT/3Dab/

I should also order a negative control, i.e. ssDNA oligo with same 
fluorophores:

- Shorthand: /56-FAM/A₁₄dC₅dT₁₄/3Dab/
- Long-form: /56-FAM/AAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTT/3Dab/

Price
-----
More expensive than the Hu2010 assay, but not exorbitant:

- Chimeric beacon: $404

  - Includes HPLC fee and extra charge for complexity.

  - Enough for 240 reactions (0.6 nmol expected yield, 50 µL reactions, 50 nM 
    beacon, 0.0025 nmol per reaction)

- DNA beacon (negative control): $133

Equipment
---------
Fluorescence parameters:

- Ex: 490 nm
- Em: 520 nm

I think these are pretty standard.  I could probably use a plate reader.
