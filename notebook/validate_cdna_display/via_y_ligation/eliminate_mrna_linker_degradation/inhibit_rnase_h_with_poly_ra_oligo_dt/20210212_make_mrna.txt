$ stepwise cdna/make_mrna f85 o129 -v 16+5.19

1. Setup 1 annealing reaction [1]:

   Reagent  Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────
   PBS              3.06 µL
   f85       5 µM  21.19 µL
   o129     10 µM   6.36 µL
   ────────────────────────
                   30.61 µL

2. Perform the annealing reaction:

   - Incubate at 95°C for 2 min.
   - Cool at room temperature.

3. Setup 1 ligation reaction:

   Reagent                    Stock     Volume
   ───────────────────────────────────────────
   nuclease-free water               208.96 µL
   T4 DNA ligase buffer         10x   30.61 µL
   BSA                         0.1%   30.61 µL
   T4 RNA ligase [2]        40 U/µL    5.30 µL
   annealed mRNA/linker  3.46154 µM   30.61 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────────────
                                     306.08 µL

4. Incubate the ligation reaction as follows:

   - 25°C for 10 min.
   - 65°C for 10 min.

5. Remove unligated linker by ultrafiltration:

   - Bring reaction to 500 µL with 8M urea.
   - Load onto a 100 kDa MWCO spin-filter [3].
   - Spin 14000g, 15 min.
   - Wash with 500 µL 8M urea.
   - Wash with 500 µL nuclease-free water.
   - Wash with water again.
   - Wash with water again, but spin for 30 min [3].
   - Invert the filter into a clean tube and spin
     1000g, 2 min to collect ligated product in a
     volume of ≈15 µL.

6. Dilute the purified mRNA to 1 µM.

7. Make 4 µL, 1 µM aliquots.

Notes:
[1] Using 0.6x linker reduces the amount of unligated
    linker, see expt #1.

    definition:

    "One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that
    converts 1 pmol of [5'-32P]pCp into its acid-
    insoluble form in 10 minutes at 5°C, using
    oligo(A) as the substrate during 3' end labeling
    of RNA."
