$ stepwise optimize_crosslinking

1. Perform a serial dilution [1]:

   - Put 13.33 μL 200 nM f15 in a tube.
   - Put 12.00 μL nuclease-free water in 3 adjacent
     tubes.
   - Transfer 1.33 μL between each tube to make 4
     10-fold dilutions.

2. Incubate at 95°C for 3 min.

3. Soak a sheet of HyBond N+ membrane in 1x TBE for
   ≈1 min

4. Pipet 2 µL of each dilution onto the membrane [2].

5. Optimize UV crosslinking time [3,4]:

   - Carefully cut the membrane into identical strips 
     containing one lane each.  
  
   - Individually wrap each strip in a single layer 
     of UV-transparent plastic wrap [5].

   - Put the strips face down on a transilluminator 
     (or face up if using a handheld light source).

   - Expose individual strips to UV light for 30 
     seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 
     minutes [6].

6. Hybridize the probe to the blotted DNA/RNA [7]:

   - Preheat ULTRAhyb-Oligo to 68°C.  Make sure that 
     any precipitated material has redissolved.

   - Add enough ULTRAhyb-Oligo to keep the membrane 
     uniformly wet (≈1 mL per 10 cm² membrane).

   - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

   - Add o135 to a concentration of 1 nM [8,9].

   - Incubate at 42°C for 14-24 h.

   - Discard probe buffer.

   - Repeat twice:
     - Add 50 mL wash buffer: 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS
     - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

   - Allow to dry.

7. Image with a laser scanner:

   laser:   784 nm
   filter:  832BP37

Notes:
[1] The final concentrations will be:
    1  2.000000e+02 nM
    2  2.000000e+01 nM
    3  2.000000e+00 nM
    4  2.000000e-01 nM

[4] This experiment should be repeated occasionally, 
    as the energy output of a particular device may 
    change over time.

[5] This is to prevent the membrane from drying out 
    during imaging.

[6] Be sure the strips are treated exactly as they 
    will be during actual use, especially the degree 
    to which they are allowed to dry before 
    irradiation.

    This product is meant for hybridizing DNA probes 
    to RNA, not DNA.  But I think it's better than 
    using either Denhardt's solution (no nucleic acid 
    blocking agents, e.g. ssDNA) or ULTRAhyb (not 
    recommended for oligonucleotide probes).

[9] Make sure that the undiluted probe never touches 
    the membrane directly.  If necessary, pour the 
    blocking solution into a clean tube, add the 
    oligo, mix, then pour back over the membrane.
