1. Prepare 2 samples for SDS PAGE:

   Reagent                  Stock    Volume        3x
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                            4.00 µL  12.00 µL
   Bolt LDS sample buffer      4x   2.50 µL   7.50 µL
   Bolt reducing agent        10x   1.00 µL   3.00 µL
   ladder,f15              160 nM   2.50 µL
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                   10.00 µL   7.50 µL/rxn

   - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

2. Run a gel:

   - Gel: 4−12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
   - Buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
   - Load 10 µL of each sample.
   - Run at 165V for 42 min.

3. Visualize RNA using TLC plate

4. Transfer the RNA to a membrane [1]:

   - Equilibrate the gel in 1x TBE for 15 min with 
     gentle shaking.  This step is not necessary if 
     the electrophoresis buffer was 1x TBE.

   - Mark the membrane, to indicate which side the 
     samples will be on.

   - Soak the following materials in 1x TBE:

     - Whatman 3MM filter paper (6 sheets)
     - HyBond N+ membrane

   - Assemble the transfer sandwich.  Remove any 
     bubbles that form [2]:

     - filter paper (3 sheets)
     - membrane (marked side facing gel)
     - gel
     - filter paper (3 sheets)

   - Place the sandwich into a semidry transfer 
     apparatus such that the membrane is nearer to 
     the anode (red).  Drain any excess buffer.

   - Run the transfer with the following settings:

     Current: 0.5-3 mA/cm²
     Voltage: 10-14 V
     Time:    30m-2h

5. Stop the transfer every 30 min, and check how much
   of the RNA has been transferred.

    before adding the next may help prevent bubbles.
