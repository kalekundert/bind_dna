$ sw gels/stain sypro-orange

1. Stain gel with SYPRO Orange [1-4]:

   - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 1x SYPRO Orange, 7.5%
     acetic acid.
   - Shake gently for 40m.

   - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 7.5% acetic acid.
   - Shake gently for 1m.

2. Image with a laser scanner:

   laser:    488 nm

[2] The stain solution may be reused up to four
    times, but sensitivity is dramatically reduced.
    Use fresh stain for optimal sensitivity.

[3] For low percentage gels and for very small
    proteins, 10% acetic acid will result in better
    retention of the protein in the gel without
    compromising sensitivity.  Do not fix the
    proteins with methanol-containing solutions.
    Methanol removes the SDS coat from proteins,
    strongly reducing the signal from SYPRO Orange
    and Red.

[4] Acetic acid will interfere with transfer of the
    proteins to a blot.  You can try diluting SYPRO
    Red or Orange in transfer buffer, but this will
    result in lower sensitivity staining.
    Alternatively, you can stain the gel with SYPRO
    Tangerine (which does not require acetic acid
    fixation) or you can stain the blot directly with
    SYPRO Ruby.
