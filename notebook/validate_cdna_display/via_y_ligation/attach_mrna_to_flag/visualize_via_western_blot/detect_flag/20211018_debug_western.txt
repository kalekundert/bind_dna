 1. Prepare 1 L 1x TBST [1]:
    
    - 100 mL 10x TBS
    - 1 mL 100% Tween-20
    - water to 1 L

 2. Prepare 50 mL blocking buffer [2]:
    
    - 5 mL 10x TBS
    - 45 mL water
    - 2.5 g nonfat dry milk (5% w/v final)
    - Mix for at least 30 min [3].

 3. Prepare 1 sample for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                         Stock    Volume
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                                   3.00 µL
    tricine SDS sample buffer          2x   5.00 µL
    NuPAGE reducing agent             10x   1.00 µL
    FLAG peptide (r5)          1000 ng/µL   1.00 µL
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────
                                           10.00 µL

    - Incubate at 85°C for 2 min.

 4. Run a gel [4]:

    gel: 16% Novex tris-tricine SDS PAGE
    buffer: tricine SDS running buffer
    ladder: 2×5 µL Chameleon 800, 10 µL FLAG-fusion
      control
    samples: 10 µL/lane
    run: 125V for 90 min

 5. Cut one of the ladder lanes out of the gel.
    Store the slice in water and in the dark.

 6. Transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane
    via iBlot [5]:

    - Place the anode stack (in its plastic tray) in
      the iBlot machine.
      - Remove any bubbles underneath the membrane.

    - Place the gel on the membrane.
      - Rinse the gel with water beforehand.
      - Remove any bubbles.

    - Soak included filter paper in water
    - Place filter paper on gel.
      - Remove any bubbles.

    - Place the cathode stack on the filter paper
      (copper side up, agarose side down, discard
      tray).
      - Remove any bubbles.

    - Attach disposable sponge to the lid of the
      iBlot machine.  Make sure the metal band is in
      the upper right, aligned with the electrode.

    - Run at 20V (P3) for 2 min.

    - Transfer the membrane to water immediately
      after the run finishes.  If the membrane dries
      out, re-wet it in methanol and rinse with water
      before blocking.

 7. Trim off unused parts of the membrane and mark
    the side facing the gel.

 8. Incubate the membrane in 20 mL blocking buffer
    for 1h at room temperature with gentle shaking
    [6].

 9. Image the gel and the ladder slice to evaluate
    how well the transfer worked.

10. Prepare a 10,000x dilution of the primary
    antibody:

    - 5 mL TBST
    - 5 mL blocking buffer
    - 1 µL monoclonal mouse anti-DYKDDDDK tag (r4)

11. Incubate the membrane in the primary antibody
    solution overnight at 4°C, in the dark and with
    gentle shaking [6].

12. Store unused blocking buffer at 4°C overnight
    [6].

13. Wash the membrane as follows [6]:

    - Wash 3x for 5 min in TBST (with shaking)

14. Prepare a 10,000x dilution of the secondary
    antibody [6].  Keep the antibody in the dark as
    much as possible:

    - 5 mL TBST
    - 5 mL blocking buffer
    - 1 µL goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (r3)

15. Incubate the membrane in the secondary antibody
    solution at room temperature for 1h, with shaking
    [6].

16. Repeat the above washing procedure [6].

17. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    784 nm
    filter:  832BP37

    - Place the membrane in the scanner protein-side
      down.

Notes:
[1] 0.1% Tween final.  I've also found recipes 
    that call for 0.2% or 0.05%, but 0.1% is 
    recommended by both Abcam and CSH:
    
    http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2013/3/pdb.rec074104.full?rss=1
    https://docs.abcam.com/pdf/protocols/buffer-and-stock-solutions-for-western-blot.pdf

[2] It's important that the blocking buffer *not* 
    contain any detergent.

[3] Undissolved particles within buffers (milk 
    powder in blocking buffer for example) 
    potentially can settle on the membrane and 
    create fluorescent artifacts.  Therefore, we 
    suggest using high quality reagents, allowing 
    suitable time for all components to fully 
    dissolve, and filter sterilize all buffers 
    (KBK: in my hands, milk cannot be sterile 
    filtered).

    Do not touch the membrane or gel with bare or
    gloved hands. This may contaminate the gel or
    membrane and interfere with further analysis. If
    you need to adjust the membrane, always use
    tweezers.

    Sometimes there is green discoloration around the
    sides of the membrane after the transfer.  This
    is due to copper ions from the transfer stacks
    being carried by liquids and deposited on the
    membrane.  These deposits do not interfere with
    downstream processes.  The stained regions can be
    cut away, but membrane washing typically results
    in their removal.  To minimize this effect, shake
    excess water off the filter paper and buffer from
    the gel before placing each on the stack.
