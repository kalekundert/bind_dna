 1. Prepare 6 samples for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                   Stock    Volume        9x
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                             5.50 µL  49.50 µL
    Bolt LDS sample buffer       4x   2.50 µL  22.50 µL
    Bolt reducing agent         10x   1.00 µL   9.00 µL
    FLAG peptide            2 ng/µL   1.00 µL
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                     10.00 µL   9.00 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

 2. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL Chameleon 800
    samples: 10 µL/lane
    run: 165V for 42 min

 3. Transfer proteins to a PVDF membrane via iBlot:
    
    - Place the anode stack (in its plastic tray) in 
      the iBlot machine.
      - Remove any bubbles underneath the membrane.
    
    - Place the gel on the membrane.
      - Rinse the gel with water beforehand.
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Soak included filter paper in water
    - Place filter paper on gel.
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Place the cathode stack on the filter paper 
      (copper side up, agarose side down).
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Attach disposable sponge to the lid of the 
      iBlot machine.
    
    - Run at 20V for 5-6 min [2].
    
    - Transfer the membrane to water immediately 
      after the run finishes.  If the membrane dries 
      out, re-wet it in methanol and rinse with 
      water before blocking.

 4. Prepare 1 L 1x TBST:
    
    - 100 mL 10x TBS
    - 1 mL Tween-20
    - water to 1 L

 5. Visualize the protein with Ponceau staining:

    - Soak membrane in Ponceau stain for 15 min.
    - Rinse membrane in water until bands are
      visible.
    - Cut each band into its own strip.
    - Label the side of the membrane with protein.
    - Repeat until stain is no longer visible (4-5x):
      - Rinse for 5-10 min in 1x TBST.

 6. Prepare 100 mL blocking buffer:
    
    - 100 mL 1x TBS
    - 5 g nonfat dry milk (5% w/v final)
    
    Mix well and filter [3].

 7. Incubate each membrane strip in blocking buffer
    for 1h at room temperature with gentle shaking
    [4].

 8. Prepare 3 dilutions of the primary antibody:

    - 12 mL TBST
    - 12 mL blocking buffer
    - 24 µL, 6 µL, 2 µL monoclonal mouse anti-
      DYKDDDDK tag

 9. Place each membrane strip in 10 mL primary
    antibody dilution [4].

10. Incubate 3 of the strips (one for each dilution)
    at room temperature for 1h, with gentle shaking.

    - Continue visualizing these strips immediately
      after the blocking is complete; don't wait for
      the overnight incubation to finish.

11. Incubate the remaining strips at 4°C overnight,
    with gentle shaking [4].

12. Discard the primary antibody solution [4].

13. Wash the membrane as follows [4,5]:

    - Rinse 2x with TBST
    - Wash 1x for 15 min in TBST (with shaking)
    - Wash 3x for 10 min in TBST (with shaking)

14. Prepare a 10,000x dilution of the secondary
    antibody [4].  Keep the antibody in the dark as
    much as possible:

    - 17 mL TBST
    - 17 mL blocking buffer
    - 3.4 µL goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW

15. Incubate each of the strips in 10 mL secondary
    antibody dilution at room temperature for 1h [4].

16. Repeat the above washing procedure [4].

17. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    784 nm
    filter:  832BP37

    - Place the membrane in the scanner protein-side
      down.

18. Dry the membrane strips overnight between two
    sheets of filter paper, covered by aluminum foil.

19. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    784 nm
    filter:  832BP37

    - Place the membrane in the scanner protein-side
      down.

    Do not touch the membrane or gel with bare or 
    gloved hands. This may contaminate the gel or 
    membrane and interfere with further analysis. 
    If you need to adjust the membrane, always use 
    forceps.

[2] Small proteins <30 kDa migrate more rapidly 
    during electrophoretic separation, and 
    consequently require less time to transfer 
    from the gel matrix to the membrane. If your 
    protein of interest is in this size range, you 
    may need to reduce the Run Time to 5–6 minutes 
    for your transfer.

[3] Undissolved particles within buffers (milk 
    powder in blocking buffer for example) 
    potentially can settle on the membrane and 
    create fluorescent artifacts.  Therefore, we 
    suggest using high quality reagents, allowing 
    suitable time for all components to fully 
    dissolve, and filter sterilize all buffers.

[5] The specifics of the washes don't seem to be
    important.  I've seen other protocols that call
    for 3x rinses and 5x 5-10 min washes.
