Attach mRNA to FLAG
*******************

2021/03/01:

Many mRNA/cDNA display methods are validated on the FLAG peptide.  This makes 
sense, since FLAG is probably very well-behaved by virtue of being short and 
very polar.  It should also be easy to detect by Western blot.

Given that FLAG seems to be a standard positive control and/or 
proof-of-principle, I think it would be smart to try getting to work in my 
hands.  My goal is to establish a good positive control, from which I can try 
to get display with Zif268 working.

Preparation
===========
.. protocol:: 20210408_make_mrna_gel.txt

- I lost all the RNA on the spin column, because I forgot that the FLAG mRNA 
  only 40 kDa---not large enough to be retained by the 100 kDa MWCO filter.  

  For comparison, o237 is 17 kDa.  I don't think a spin filter will be adequate 
  to separate these.  For now I'll probably just skip this step, and maybe I'll 
  try to do a gel purification eventually.
