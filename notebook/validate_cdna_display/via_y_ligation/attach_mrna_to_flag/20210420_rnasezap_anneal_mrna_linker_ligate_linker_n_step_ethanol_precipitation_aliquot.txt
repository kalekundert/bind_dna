1. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
   (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

2. Setup 1 annealing reaction [1]:

   Reagent  Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────
   PBS        10x   1.78 µL
   f111     10 µM  10.00 µL
   o237     10 µM   6.00 µL
   ────────────────────────
                   17.78 µL

3. Perform the annealing reaction:

   - Incubate at 95°C for 2 min.
   - Cool at room temperature.

4. Setup 1 ligation reaction:

   Reagent                        Stock     Volume
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   nuclease-free water                   123.96 µL
   T4 RNA ligase buffer             10x   17.78 µL
   ATP                            10 mM   17.78 µL
   T4 RNA ligase (NEB M0204)    10 U/µL    0.50 µL
   annealed mRNA/linker       5.6243 µM   17.78 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────
                                         177.80 µL

5. Incubate the ligation reaction as follows:

   - 25°C for 10 min.
   - 65°C for 10 min.

6. Label the product: f113

7. Perform an ethanol precipitation [2,3]:

   - Add magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) to 10 mM.
   - Add glycogen to 50 ng/µL.
   - Add 2 volumes 100% ethanol and mix well.
   - If necessary, divide the sample between
     microfuge tubes such that none holds more than
     400 µL.
   - Incubate at -20°C overnight [4].
   - Centrifuge >7500g, 60 min, 4°C.  Remove the
     supernatant, but save it in case the
     precipitation needs to be repeated.
   - Add 800 µL recently-prepared 70% ethanol [5].
   - Centrifuge >7500g, 2 min, 4°C.  Discard
     supernatant.
   - Centrifuge >7500g, 30 s, 4°C.  Discard any
     remaining supernatant.
   - Leave the tube open at room temperature until
     ethanol has evaporated [6].
   - Resuspend the pellet in 10 µL of water [7].

8. Make 5 µL, 2 µM aliquots.

Notes:
[1] Using 0.6x linker reduces the amount of unligated
    linker, see expt #1.

[3] This protocol was optimized for 100 ng/µL nucleic
    acid.  If your sample is substantially more
    dilute, it may be necessary to compensate by
    increasing the incubation time, the
    centrifugation time, or the centrifugation speed.

[4] DNA can be stored indefinitely in ethanolic
    solutions at either 0°C or −20°C.

[5] Ethanol evaporates more quickly than water, so a
    solution that was 70% ethanol several months ago
    may be significantly more aqueous now.  If you
    are unsure, 100 µL of 70% EtOH should weigh 88.6
    mg.

[6] Do not dry pellets of nucleic acid in a
    lyophilizer, as this causes denaturation of small
    (<400-nucleotide) fragments of DNA and greatly
    reduces the recovery of larger fragments of DNA.
    If necessary, the open tube containing the
    redissolved DNA can be incubated for 2-3 minutes
    at 45°C in a heating block to allow any traces of
    ethanol to evaporate.

[7] Up to 50% of the DNA is smeared on the wall of
    the tube. To recover all of the DNA, push a bead
    of fluid backward and forward over the
    appropriate quadrant of wall with a pipette tip.
