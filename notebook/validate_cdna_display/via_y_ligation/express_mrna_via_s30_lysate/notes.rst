Express mRNA via S30 lysate
***************************

Before I an do experiments with Promega S30 lysate, I need to determine the 
optimal amount of mRNA to use in reactions.  My plan is to closely follow the 
protocol from :expt:`18` (2020/02/26).

Results
=======
.. protocol:: 20210219_optimize_purefrex_s30.txt

.. figure:: 20210219_optimize_purefrex_s30.svg

.. datatable:: 20210219_optimize_s30.xlsx

Discussion
==========
- The optimal mWasabi mRNA concentration for the Promega S30 lysate is 200 nM.  
  Higher concentrations do not give higher yields.
