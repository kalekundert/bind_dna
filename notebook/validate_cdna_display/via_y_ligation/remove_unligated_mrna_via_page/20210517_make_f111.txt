1. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
   (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

2. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction [1]:

   Reagent                  Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────────────────────
   nuclease-free water              6.23 µL
   reaction buffer            10x   2.25 µL
   rNTP mix                100 mM   9.00 µL
   HiScribe T7                10x   2.25 µL
   f110                 146 ng/µL  10.27 µL
   ────────────────────────────────────────
                                   30.00 µL

   - Mix reagents in the order given.
   - Ok to handle at room temperature.

3. Incubate at 37°C for 4h [2,3].

4. Label the product: f111

5. Purify RNA using Zymo Clean & Concentrator spin
   columns:

   - If necessary, bring each sample to 50 µL.
   - Add 2 volumes RNA binding buffer; mix.
   - Add 3 volumes >95% ethanol; mix.
   - Load sample on spin column.
   - Spin 1 min, 16000g; discard flow-through.
   - Add 400 µL RNA prep buffer.
   - Spin 30s, 16000g; discard flow-through.
   - Add 700 µL RNA wash buffer.
   - Spin 30s, 16000g; discard flow-through.
   - Add 400 µL RNA wash buffer.
   - Spin 60s, 16000g; discard flow-through.
   - Add 25 µL nuclease-free water.
   - Spin 30s, 16000g.

6. Make 5 uL, 10 µM aliquots.

[2] For reaction times longer than 60 minutes, we
    recommend using a dry air incubator or a PCR
    instrument, to prevent evaporation.

[3] Reaction time is different than usual because the
    template is short (<300 bp).
