$ stepwise optimize_crosslinking

1. Prepare samples for TBE/urea PAGE:

   Reagent            Stock    Volume
   ──────────────────────────────────
   water                     24.00 µL
   sample buffer         2x  30.00 µL
   f15            200 ng/µL   6.00 µL
   ──────────────────────────────────
                             60.00 µL

   - Incubate at 70°C for 3 min.

2. Run a gel:

   - Use a 6% TBE/urea PAGE gel.
   - Load 10 µL of each sample.
   - Run at 180V for 40 min.

3. Transfer the RNA to a membrane [1]:

   - Equilibrate the gel in 1x TBE for 15 min with 
     gentle shaking.  This step is not necessary if 
     the electrophoresis buffer was 1x TBE.

   - Mark the membrane, to indicate which side the 
     samples will be on.

   - Soak the following materials in 1x TBE:

     - Whatman 3MM filter paper (6 sheets)
     - HyBond N+ membrane

   - Assemble the transfer sandwich.  Remove any 
     bubbles that form [2]:

     - filter paper (3 sheets)
     - membrane (marked side facing gel)
     - gel
     - filter paper (3 sheets)

   - Place the sandwich into a semidry transfer 
     apparatus such that the membrane is nearer to 
     the anode (red).  Drain any excess buffer.

   - Run the transfer with the following settings:

     Current: 0.5-3 mA/cm²
     Voltage: 10-14 V
     Time:    30m-2h

4. Optimize UV crosslinking time [3,4]:

   - Carefully cut the membrane into identical strips 
     containing one lane each.  
  
   - Individually wrap each strip in a single layer 
     of UV-transparent plastic wrap [5].

   - Put the strips face down on a transilluminator 
     (or face up if using a handheld light source).

   - Expose individual strips to UV light for 30 
     seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 
     minutes [6].

5. Hybridize the probe to the blotted DNA/RNA [7]:

   - Preheat ULTRAhyb-Oligo to 68°C.  Make sure that 
     any precipitated material has redissolved.

   - Add enough ULTRAhyb-Oligo to keep the membrane 
     uniformly wet (≈1 mL per 10 cm² membrane).

   - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

   - Add o135 to a concentration of 1 nM [8,9].

   - Incubate at 42°C for 14-24 h.

   - Discard probe buffer.

   - Repeat twice:
     - Add 50 mL wash buffer: 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS
     - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

   - Allow to dry.

6. Image with a laser scanner:

   laser:   784 nm
   filter:  832BP37

[2] Pipetting a few mL of buffer onto each layer 
    before adding the next may help prevent bubbles.

[4] This experiment should be repeated occasionally, 
    as the energy output of a particular device may 
    change over time.

[5] This is to prevent the membrane from drying out 
    during imaging.

[6] Be sure the strips are treated exactly as they 
    will be during actual use, especially the degree 
    to which they are allowed to dry before 
    irradiation.

[7] ULTRAhyb-Oligo manual:

    This product is meant for hybridizing DNA probes 
    to RNA, not DNA.  But I think it's better than 
    using either Denhardt's solution (no nucleic acid 
    blocking agents, e.g. ssDNA) or ULTRAhyb (not 
    recommended for oligonucleotide probes).

[9] Make sure that the undiluted probe never touches 
    the membrane directly.  If necessary, pour the 
    blocking solution into a clean tube, add the 
    oligo, mix, then pour back over the membrane.
