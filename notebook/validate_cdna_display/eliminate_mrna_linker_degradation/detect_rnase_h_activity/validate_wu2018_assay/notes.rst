Validate Wu2018 assay
*********************

Considerations
==============
I couldn't access [Wu2018]_ through Harvard, but I was able to find the first 
two pages (strangely) from some other website.  Fortunately, these two pages 
contained all of the details needed to perform the assay (although none of the 
data on how well it works).
