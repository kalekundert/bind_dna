Considerations
==============

Reagents
--------
- cP1:

  - "c": "chimera", referring to the DNA/RNA hybrid
  - Sequence: CATCTCTTCTCCGAGCCGGTCGAAATAGTTGGTrGrArArGrArGrArUrG
  - Price: $83

- P2:

  - Sequence: CATCTCTTCTCCGAGCCGGTCGAAATAGTTGGTGAAGAGACG
  - Price: $6

- DNAzyme:

  - Sequence: CATCTCTTCTCCGAGCCGGTCGAAATAGTTGGT
  - Price: $5

- MB1:

  - "MB": "Molecular beacon"
  - Sequence: /56-FAM/CCACCATCACCAACTATrAGGAAGAGATGTTTGGTGG/3BHQ_1/
  - Price: $202

- MB2:

  - Sequence: /56-FAM/CCACCATCACCAACTATAGGAAGAGATGTTTGGTGG/3BHQ_1/
  - Same as MB1, but without the ribonucleotide that will be recognized by the 
    DNAzyme.
  - I don't think I need to order this oligo.  [Wang2017]_ used it as a 
    control, but I don't think I need to repeat that control.
