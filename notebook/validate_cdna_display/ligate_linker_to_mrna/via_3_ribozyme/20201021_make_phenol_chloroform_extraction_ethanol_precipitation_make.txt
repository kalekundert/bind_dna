 1. Setup 1 XmnI digestion [1]:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    p175             200 ng/µL  40.00 µL
    CutSmart Buffer        10x   4.89 µL
    XmnI               20 U/µL   4.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                48.89 µL

 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [2]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 65°C for 20 min

 3. Label the product: f96

 4. Purify DNA via phenol-chloroform extraction:

    - Dilute or divide your sample as necessary to 
      ensure that each tube has between 100-700 µL [3].

    - Repeat twice:

      - Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
        alcohol (pH≈8 for DNA) to the tube.

      - Vortex vigorously to mix the phases.
   
      - Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
        separate the phases.
   
      - Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new tube, 
        being careful not to transfer any of the protein 
        at the phase interface.
 
    - Extract the sample with an equal volume of 
      chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove the phenol.

 5. Perform an ethanol precipitation [4]:

    - Add 1/10 volume 3M sodium acetate, pH=5.2 or 
      other appropriate salt [5].

    - Add 2 volumes ice-cold ethanol and mix well.

    - If necessary, divide the sample between microfuge 
      tubes such that none holds more than 400 µL [6].

    - Incubate at 0°C for 15-30 min [7,8].

    - Centrifuge maximum speed, 10 min, 4°C [9] and 
      discard supernatant.

    - Add 800 µL 70% ethanol.

    - Centrifuge maximum speed, 10 min, 4°C [9] and 
      discard supernatant.

    - Leave tube open at room temperature until ethanol 
      has evaporated [10,11].

 6. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 7. Setup 3 in vitro transcription reactions [12,13] by 
    mixing the following reagents at room temperature

 8. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours [14].

 9. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
    RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

10. Nanodrop to determine the RNA concentration.

11. Dilute (if desired) enough RNA to make several 
    10 μM aliquots and to run a gel.  Keep any left- 
    over RNA undiluted.  Flash-freeze in liquid N₂
    and store at -80°C.

12. Prepare samples for TBE/urea PAGE:

    water                      4.00 µL  18.00 µL
    sample buffer         2x   5.00 µL  22.50 µL
    sample         200 ng/µL   1.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────────────

    - Incubate at 70°C for 3 min.

13. Run a gel:

    - Use a 6% TBE/urea PAGE gel.
    - Load 10 µL of each sample.
    - Run at 180V for 40 min.

14. Stain gel with GelRed:

    - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 3x GelRed [15].
    - Shake gently for 30 min.

15. Image with a 302 nm UV transilluminator.

16. Label the products: f92,f94,f97

Notes:
 [1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
     (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume 
     should not exceed 10% of the total reaction 
     volume to prevent star activity due to excess 
     glycerol.

 [2] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if 
     the DNA will be purified before use.

 [3] It is difficult to do the extraction with volumes 
     smaller than 100 µL. The sample can be 
     concentrated again after precipitation.

     Green2016: 10.1101/pdb.prot093377

 [5] 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2: Used for most 
     routine precipitations of DNA and RNA.

     2M ammonium acetate: Used to reduce the 
     coprecipitation of unwanted contaminants (e.g.  
     dNTPs or oligosaccharides) or when nucleic acids 
     are precipitated after digestion of agarose gels 
     with agarase. It should not be used when the 
     precipitated nucleic acid is to be 
     phosphorylated.

     200 mM sodium chloride: Used if the DNA sample 
     contains SDS.

     800 mM lithium chloride: Used when high 
     concentrations of ethanol are required for 
     precipitation (e.g. large RNAs).

 [6] Alternatively, an ultracentrifuge can be used 
     instead of a table-top centrifuge.

 [7] Usually 15-30 minutes is sufficient, but when the 
     size of the DNA is small (<100 nucleotides) or 
     when it is present in small amounts (<100 pg/µL), 
     extend the period of storage to at least 1 hour 
     and add MgCl₂ to a final concentration of 10 mM.

 [8] DNA can be stored indefinitely in ethanolic 
     solutions at either 0°C or −20°C.

 [9] Mark the edge of the tube so you can find the 
     pellet.  If low concentrations of DNA (<20 pg/µL) 
     or very small fragments (<100 nucleotides) are 
     being processed, more extensive centrifugation 
     may be required.  Centrifugation at 100,000g for 
     20-30 minutes allows the recovery of picogram 
     quantities of nucleic acid in the absence of 
     carrier.

[10] Do not dry pellets of nucleic acid in a 
     lyophilizer, as this causes denaturation of small 
     (<400-nucleotide) fragments of DNA and greatly 
     reduces the recovery of larger fragments of DNA. 

     If necessary, the open tube containing the 
     redissolved DNA can be incubated for 2-3 minutes 
     at 45°C in a heating block to allow any traces of 
     ethanol to evaporate.

[11] Up to 50% of the DNA is smeared on the wall of 
     the tube. To recover all of the DNA, push a bead 
     of fluid backward and forward over the 
     appropriate quadrant of wall with a pipette tip.

[13] I've found that T7 kits which have been in the 
     freezer for more than ≈4 weeks seem to produce 
     more degraded RNA.

[14] Use a thermocycler to prevent evaporation.

[15] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution 
     enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye 
     precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

     Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
     Store staining solution at room temperature
     protected from light.
