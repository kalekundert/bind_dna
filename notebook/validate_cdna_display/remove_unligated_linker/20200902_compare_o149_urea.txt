 1. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 2. Setup 1 annealing reaction:

    Reagent  Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────
    water           10.50 µL
    PBS        10x   2.00 µL
    f85       5 µM   5.00 µL
    o129     10 µM   2.50 µL
    ────────────────────────
                    20.00 µL

 3. Perform the annealing reaction:

    - Incubate at 95°C for 2 min.
    - Cool at room temperature.

 4. Reserve 0.44 µL of the annealed product for the
    '−ligate' lane of the gel, and dilute it to 4.44
    µL with nuclease-free water.

 5. Setup 1 ligation reaction:

    Reagent                 Stock     Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    water                          123.75 µL
    T4 DNA ligase buffer      10x   18.00 µL
    BSA                      0.1%   18.00 µL
    T4 RNA ligase         40 U/µL    2.25 µL
    annealed mRNA/linker  1.25 µM   18.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────────
                                   180.00 µL

 6. Incubate the ligation reaction as follows:

    - 25°C for 10 min.
    - 65°C for 10 min.

 7. Reserve 4.44 µL of the ligated product for the
    '−filter' lane of the gel.

 8. Split the ligation reaction into 4 40 µL samples, 
    to be prepared as follows:

    urea:  −  +  −  +
    o194:  −  −  +  +

 9. Remove unligated linker using a MWCO spin filter:

    - For samples with o194:
      - Add 5 µL 100 µM o194.
      - Incubate at 95°C for 2 min [1]

    - Bring reactions to 500 µL with 8M urea or water.
    - Load onto a 100 kDa MWCO spin-filter [2].
    - Spin 14000g, 15 min, 4°C.
    - Wash with 500 µL 8M urea or water.
    - Wash with 500 µL water.

    - For samples with urea:
      - Wash with water again.
      - Wash with water again.

    - Invert the filter into a clean tube and spin 
      1000g, 2 min to collect ligated product in a 
      volume of ≈15 µL.

10. Prepare samples for TBE/urea PAGE:

    Reagent                           Stock    Volume        9x
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    formamide loading buffer             2x   5.00 µL  45.00 µL
    o194                             100 µM   0.56 µL   5.04 µL
    −ligate,−filter,−/−,+/−,−/+,+/+  125 nM   4.44 µL
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                             10.00 µL   5.56 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 3 min.

11. Run a gel:

    - Use a 6% TBE/urea PAGE gel.
    - Load 10 µL of each sample.
    - Run at 180V for 40 min.

12. Stain gel with GelGreen:

    - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 3x GelGreen [3].
    - Shake gently for 30 min.

13. Image with a laser scanner:

    lasers:   488 nm   658 nm
    filters:  518BP22  710BP40

Notes:
[1] When preparing samples for PAGE, this incubation 
    step is 70°C for 3 min.  I chose to use a higher 
    temperature here because there is no formamide in 
    the buffer to help lower melting temperatures.

[3] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution 
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye 
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

    Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.
