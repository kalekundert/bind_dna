Replicate [Doshi2014]
*********************

Erkin has successfully coupled protein and mRNA using the protocol described by 
[Doshi2014]_.  Given this, I'm very hopeful that I can get the same protocol to 
work.  This protocol is very similar to the others I've tried, with a few 
differences:

- Splint ligation.
- Î» exonuclease is added to digest the splint and any unreacted linker.
- Magnetic oligo-dT(25) beads are used to purify the mRNA after both ligation 
  and translation.

I'm going to start by trying to reproduce the protocol from the paper exactly, 
i.e. using all the same reagents.  Erkin has these reagents, so I don't need to 
order them myself.  Once I can get that to work, I'll have to figure out how to 
attach my RT primer (and maybe some fluorescent moieties).
