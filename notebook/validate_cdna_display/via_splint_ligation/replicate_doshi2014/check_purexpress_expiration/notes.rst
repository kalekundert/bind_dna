Check PURExpress expiration
***************************

I didn't really see any evidence of protein expression in :expt:`147`, so I 
want to make sure that my PURExpress is still active (given that I ordered it 
several years ago).  Note that I aliquoted the PURExpress immediately upon 
receiving it, and have kept it at −80°C ever since.  But it's been several 
years, and there have been several times where the freezer warmed significantly 
above −80°C.
