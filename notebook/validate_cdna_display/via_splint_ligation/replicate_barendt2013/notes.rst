***********************
Replicate [Barendt2013]
***********************

My goal for this experiment is to reproduce the mRNA display protocol described 
by [Barendt2013]_.  In general I want to follow [Barendt2013]_ as close as 
possible, but I'll do some things differently:

- Order phosphorylated linker oligos.
- Use mWasabi gene instead of DARPin, both for improved solubility and more 
  easy debugging.
