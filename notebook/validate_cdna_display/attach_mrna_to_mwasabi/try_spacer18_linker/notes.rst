Try spacer-18 linker
********************

[Liu2000]_ shows that a "flexible linker" (containing 3 spacer-9 
phosphoramidite residues) gives higher efficiency coupling than a "standard 
linker" with only the adenosines.  I have a linker (o128) with 4 spacer-18 
phosphoramidite residues, based on the linker from [Naimudden2016]_.  I want to 
compare this spacer-18 linker with my poly-A linker (o129) to see which 
performs better.  Depending on the results, I might also order and test the 
spacer-9 linker from [Liu2000]_.

Note that all of these spacers are optimized for use with rabbit reticulocyte 
lysate.  As the length of the linker is known to be an important parameter 
(e.g. [Liu2000]_ shows that linkers in the range of 19-30 nt are comparable, 
but linkers longer or shorter than that are markedly less efficient), it may be 
necessary to use a different linker length with a different ribosome.

- Neither linker exhibits any coupling.

- You can see the difference between the two linkers in the gel, though, which 
  is nice.
