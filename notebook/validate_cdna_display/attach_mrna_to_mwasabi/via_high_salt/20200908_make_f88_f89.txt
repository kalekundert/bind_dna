1. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
   (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

2. Setup 2 annealing reactions [1]:

   Reagent    Stock   Volume      2.2x
   ───────────────────────────────────
   water             4.60 µL  10.12 µL
   PBS          10x  0.80 µL   1.76 µL
   f85         5 µM  2.00 µL   4.40 µL
   o128,o129  10 µM  0.60 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────
                     8.00 µL   7.40 µL/rxn

3. Perform the annealing reactions:

   - Incubate at 95°C for 2 min.
   - Cool at room temperature.

4. Setup 2 ligation reactions:

   Reagent                 Stock    Volume       2.2x
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                          55.00 µL  121.00 µL
   T4 DNA ligase buffer      10x   8.00 µL   17.60 µL
   BSA                      0.1%   8.00 µL   17.60 µL
   T4 RNA ligase         40 U/µL   1.00 µL    2.20 µL
   annealed mRNA/linker  1.25 µM   8.00 µL
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  80.00 µL   72.00 µL/rxn

5. Incubate the ligation reactions as follows:

   - 25°C for 10 min.
   - 65°C for 10 min.

6. Remove unligated linker by ultrafiltration:

   - Bring reaction to 500 µL with 8M urea.
   - Load onto a 100 kDa MWCO spin-filter [2].
   - Spin 14000g, 15 min.
   - Wash with 200 µL 7M urea.
   - Wash with 500 µL nuclease-free water.
   - Wash with water again.
   - Wash with water again.
   - Invert the filter into a clean tube and spin 
     1000g, 2 min to collect ligated product in a 
     volume of ≈15 µL.

7. Label the products f88,f89

8. Make 4 µL, 333 nM aliquots [3].

Notes:
[1] Using 0.6x linker reduces the amount of unligated
    linker, see expt #1.

[2] Amicon UFC510024

[3] This concentration refers to the ligated species
    (f88 and f89).  There is also an approximately
    equal amount of unligated mRNA (f85) in these
    reactions.
