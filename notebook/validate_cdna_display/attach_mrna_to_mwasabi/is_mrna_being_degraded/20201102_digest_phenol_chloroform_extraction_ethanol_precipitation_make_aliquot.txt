 1. Setup 1 XmnI digestion [1]:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    p175             200 ng/µL  40.00 µL
    CutSmart Buffer        10x   4.89 µL
    XmnI               20 U/µL   4.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                48.89 µL

 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [2]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 65°C for 20 min

 3. Purify DNA via phenol-chloroform extraction:

    - Dilute or divide your sample as necessary to 
      ensure that each tube has between 100-700 µL [3].

    - Repeat twice:

      - Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
        alcohol (pH≈8 for DNA) to the tube.

      - Vortex vigorously to mix the phases.
   
      - Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
        separate the phases.
   
      - Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new tube, 
        being careful not to transfer any of the protein 
        at the phase interface.
 
    - Extract the sample with an equal volume of 
      chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove the phenol.

 4. Perform an ethanol precipitation [4,5]:

    - Add sodium acetate, pH=5.2 to 300 mM.

    - Add glycogen to 50 ng/µL.

    - Add 3 volumes 100% ethanol and mix well.

    - If necessary, divide the sample between
      microfuge tubes such that none holds more than
      400 µL.

    - Centrifuge >7500g, 60 min, 4°C.  Remove the
      supernatant, but save it in case the
      precipitation needs to be repeated.

    - Add 800 µL 70% ethanol.

    - Centrifuge >7500g, 2 min, 4°C and discard
      supernatant.

    - Leave the tube open at room temperature until
      ethanol has evaporated [6].

    - Resuspend the pellet in 10 µL of nuclease-free
      water [7].

 5. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 6. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction [8,9] by 
    mixing the following reagents at room temperature 
    in the order given:

    Reagent                  Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    nuclease-free water              6.00 µL
    reaction buffer            10x   2.00 µL
    rNTP mix                100 mM   8.00 µL
    HiScribe T7                10x   2.00 µL
    f96                  500 ng/µL   2.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────────
                                    20.00 µL

 7. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours [10].

 8. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
    RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

 9. Label the product: f97

10. Make 5 µL, 10 µM aliquots.

Notes:
 [1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
     (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume 
     should not exceed 10% of the total reaction 
     volume to prevent star activity due to excess 
     glycerol.

 [2] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if 
     the DNA will be purified before use.

 [3] It is difficult to do the extraction with volumes 
     smaller than 100 µL. The sample can be 
     concentrated again after precipitation.

 [5] This protocol was optimized for 100 ng/µL nucleic
     acid.  If your sample is substantially more
     dilute, it may be necessary to compensate by
     increasing the incubation time, the
     centrifugation time, or the centrifugation speed.

 [6] Do not dry pellets of nucleic acid in a
     lyophilizer, as this causes denaturation of small
     (<400-nucleotide) fragments of DNA and greatly
     reduces the recovery of larger fragments of DNA.

     If necessary, the open tube containing the
     redissolved DNA can be incubated for 2-3 minutes
     at 45°C in a heating block to allow any traces of
     ethanol to evaporate.

 [7] Up to 50% of the DNA is smeared on the wall of
     the tube. To recover all of the DNA, push a bead
     of fluid backward and forward over the
     appropriate quadrant of wall with a pipette tip.

 [9] I've found that T7 kits which have been in the 
     freezer for more than ≈4 weeks seem to produce 
     more degraded RNA.

[10] Use a thermocycler to prevent evaporation.
