Anneal linker-N with temperature
********************************

I was able to find a number of different temperature protocols for annealing 
oligos.  They're similar for the most part---start hot, gradually cool---and I 
generally get the impression that any would be fine, but I want to test to see 
if there's any reason to prefer the longer, slower protocols.
