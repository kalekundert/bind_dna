Detect binding via CIS display
******************************

After talking with Kettner and David, I realized that DNA-display techniques 
other than cDNA-display might offer some advantages in terms of fidelity or 
ease-of-use that I should consider.  

CIS-display employs a protein (e.g. RepA or P2A) that binds a specific DNA 
sequence as it's being translated.  Since transcription and translation occur 
simultaneously in vitro, this protein can be made to bind its own coding 
sequence.

- Advantages:

   - No special reagents required.

- Disadvantages:

   - DNA-binding domain is fairly large:

      - RepA: 33 kDa

      - P2A: 86 kDa

   - RepA binding to DNA is noncovalent.

   - Seems like a bad idea to use known DNA binding domains in an assay meant 
     to measure DNA-binding.  Especially because I'm interested in designed 
     proteins that may not bind DNA that well.  Could RepA/P2A drown out my 
     signal?
