Ligate linker-N with optimized conditions
*****************************************

In :expt:`20191219_anneal_linker_n_with_salt` and 
:expt:`20200129_anneal_linker_n_with_temperature` I determined reasonable salt 
and temperature conditions for annealing.  These conditions seemed to give rise 
to efficient ligation in :expt:`20200129_ligate_with_5_phosphorylation`.  Here 
I want to test if this protocol also gives efficient ligation for linker-N.
