Prepare DNA targets

- The reactions were very clean.

- Yields were lower than I expected, 20 µL at ≈50 ng/µL.  The product is 
  relatively small; I wonder if PCR cleanup would give better yield than the 
  beads (or if I should've used more beads).

.. todo::

   Once sgRNA arrives, talk to Jorge to get some protein and the protocol for 
   attaching DNA to the HUH-tag.
