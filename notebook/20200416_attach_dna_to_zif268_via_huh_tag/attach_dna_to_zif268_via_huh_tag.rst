Attach DNA to Zif268 via HUH-tag
********************************

See :expt:`20200219_attach_dna_to_dcas9_via_huh_tag` for the motivation behind 
using HUH-tags.  Here I want to show that I can attach DNA to Zif268.  I don't 
expect the Zif268-PCV2 fusion to behave differently than dCas9-PCV2.

I'm having trouble amplifying f45.  I'm going to check my primers and try a 
temperature gradient.  I should also sequence p106, since I got it from Jorge 
and I haven't confirmed its sequence myself.
