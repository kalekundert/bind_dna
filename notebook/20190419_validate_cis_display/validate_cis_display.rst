Validate CIS display
********************
After talking with Kettner and David, I realized that DNA-display techniques 
other than cDNA-display might offer some advantages in terms of fidelity or 
ease-of-use that I should consider.  

CIS-display employs a protein (e.g. RepA or P2A) that binds a specific DNA 
sequence as it's being translated.  Since transcription and translation occur 
simultaneously in vitro, this protein can be made to bind its own coding 
sequence.
