Ligate with 5' phosphorylation
******************************

.. todo::

   The 5' end of linker-N must be phosphorylated in order for it to be ligated 
   to the mRNA.  [Naimudden2016]_ used T4 kinase to phosphorylate linker-N 
   during the ligation reaction.  Other Y-ligation methods, e.g.  
   [Kitamura2002]_, avoid the enzymatic phosphorylation step by ordering 
   phosphorylated oligos.

   I think that the latter approach (i.e. phosphorylated oligos) makes more 
   sense.  This approach guarantees that every linker is phosphorylated, and 
   eliminates the possibility of the phosphorylation step causing problems.  
   The extra modification won't even add much to the price, given how expensive 
   linker-N is already.  I will test this hypothesis by doing ligation 
   reactions with posphorylated (o93) and non-phosphorylated linkers (o99), 
   side-by-side.
