*****************************
Create minimal cloning vector
*****************************

Before I start this project, I want to make a cloning vector that will be easy 
to work with and give high miniprep yields.  This isn't really an experiment, 
but I wanted some place to plan and keep files related to this.  What I want to 
accomplish is:

- Use the pUC19 backbone, because it is the highest copy number.

- Remove the BsaI and XmnI sites from AmpR

- Create golden gate cloning sites using BsaI and overhangs from Potapov2018.

- Remove most of the unannotated sequence between the lacZ gene and AmpR/ORI.  
  This includes removing the BsmBI and SapI sites.
