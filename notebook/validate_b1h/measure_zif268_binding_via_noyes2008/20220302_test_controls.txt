1. Grow overnight cultures of s4 and s5 in 3 mL
   LB+Carb+Kan [1].

   - Use fresh colonies (i.e. either transformed or
     restreaked within 1 week).
   - Incubate at 37°C overnight with shaking.

2. Grow day cultures:

   - Inoculate 3 mL LB+Carb+Kan with 30 µL saturated
     overnight culture.
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking until OD≈0.4

3. Wash cells with minimal media:

   - Repeat 4x:
     - Spin 3500g, 3 min, 4°C.
     - Resuspend in 1 mL NM.
   - Dilute to OD=0.1

4. Perform a serial dilution [2]:

   - Put 100.00 μL 0.1 OD cells in a tube.
   - Put 90.00 μL NM in 5 adjacent tubes.
   - Transfer 10.00 μL between each tube to make 6
     10-fold dilutions.

5. Plate 5 µL of each dilution in triplicate on each
   plate.

Notes:
[1] [Noyes2008] uses 2xYT instead of LB.  I don't
    think this detail matters, although the cells may
    grow faster in richer media.

[2] The final concentrations will be:
    1  1.000000e-01 OD
    2  1.000000e-02 OD
    3  1.000000e-03 OD
    4  1.000000e-04 OD
    5  1.000000e-05 OD
    6  1.000000e-06 OD
