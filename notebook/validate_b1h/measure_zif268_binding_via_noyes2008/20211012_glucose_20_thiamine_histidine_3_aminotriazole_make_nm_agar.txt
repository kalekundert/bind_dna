1. Prepare 100 mL 200 mg/mL (20% w/v) glucose:
   
   - 20 g glucose
   - water to 100 mL
   - sterile filter (0.2 µm)

2. Prepare 1 mg/mL thiamine-HCl [1]:
   
   - 10 mg thiamine
   - 10 mL water

3. Prepare 50 mL 100 mM histidine:
   
   - 575.75 mg L-histidine
   - water to 50 mL

4. Prepare 10 mL 1M 3-AT [3,4]:
   
   - 840.8 mg 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole
   - water to 10 mL
   - sterile filter (0.2 µm)

5. Prepare 500 mL NM-agar [5]:
   
   - 5.25 g M9 salts (1x final)
   - 385 mg −His DO supplement (Clontech 630422) [6]
   - water to 380 mL
   - 7.5 g agar (1.5% w/v final)
   
   - Autoclave at 121°C for 15 min
   - Cool to ≈55°C
   
   - 10 mL 20% glucose (4 mg/mL final)
   - 5 mL 1 mg/mL thiamine (10 µg/mL final)
   - 5 mL 100 mM MgSO₄ (1 mM final)
   - 50 µL 100 mM ZnSO₄ (10 µM final)
   - 50 µL 1M CaCl₂ (100 µM final)
   - 250 µL 50 mg/mL kanamycin (25 µg/mL, 0.5x final)
   - 500 µL 100 mg/mL carbenicillin (100 µg/mL, 1x final)
   - 5 µL 1M IPTG (10 µM final)

6. Add selective reagents [7]:
   
   - Split NM-agar into 4x 120 mL parts.
   
   - 5 mM His:  6 mL 100 mM histidine
   - 1 mM 3-AT: 120 µL 1M 3-AT
   - 2 mM 3-AT: 240 µL 1M 3-AT
   - 4 mM 3-AT: 480 µL 1M 3-AT

7. Pour 20-25 mL plates.

Notes:
[1] I make this recipe with "hydrated" thiamine.  
    The degree of hydration is unknown, so this is 
    not particularly accurate.

[2] Sigma H6034.  According to the label, solubility is 50 mg/mL = 322 mM.

[6] This supplement isn't exactly what [Noyes2008] 
    calls for: it's missing 9 of the amino acids, 
    and includes uracil (although I've ordered the 
    −His/−Ura supplement).

[7] 3-AT is heat labile and will be destroyed if 
    added to media hotter that 55°C.

    Store plates containing 3-AT at 4°C for up to 
    2 months.
