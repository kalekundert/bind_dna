- Transform the following plasmids into the 
  selection strain:

  - Mix on ice:
    - 80 µL selection strain
    - 100 ng pB1H2ω2-Zif268
    - 50 ng reporter pH3U3 plasmid containing one 
      of four different Zif268 finger 1 binding 
      sites (GCG, GCA, GAG, or GGG)

  - Electroporate.
  - Add 1 mL SOC.
  - Incubate at 37°C for 1h.

- Plate cells on rich media plates (2xYT, 25 µg/mL 
  Kan, 100 µg/mL Carb).

- Incubate at 37°C overnight.

- Inoculate 5 mL rich media (2xYT +Kan +Carb) with 
  a single colony for each strain.

- Incubate at 37 overnight.

- Inoculate 5 mL rich media (2xYT +Kan +Carb) with 
  50 µL saturated overnight culture.

- Incubate at 37°C with shaking until OD600 
  reaches 0.2-0.4.

- Acclimate cells to NM media:
  - Spin at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes.
  - Resuspend in 5 mL NM media supplemented with 
    200 µM uracil [2].
  - Incubate at 37°C for 1h with rotating.

- Wash cells 4x:
  - Spin at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes.
  - Resuspend in 5 mL (1 mL on last iteration) NM 
    media supplemented with 200 µM uracil.

- Plate a 10x serial dilution of 20 µL of the 
  washed cells on rich media (2xYT, 25 µg/mL Kan, 
  100 µg/mL Carb).  

- Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.  
  Meanwhile, store the remaining 980 µL of washed 
  cells at 4°C.

- Dilute a fraction of the remaining cultures to 
  ≈500 cells per 750 µL [3].

- Plate 750 µL of each culture on selective plates 
  in triplicate.

- Wrap plates in parafilm.

- Incubate at 37°C for 36-48h.

- Count colonies.

- Resuspend the colonies on each plate in 5 mL 
  2xYT. Pool resuspensions for triplicate plates.

- Spin at 3000 rpm for 15 min.

- Resuspend pellets in 100 mL 2xYT.

- Measure OD600 in triplicate.

    Expected results: Supplementary figure 5

[2] For screens, it seems that the wash media does 
    not have uracil.

[3] [Noyes2008] does not make it clear what the 
    cells should be diluted into.  I assume that 
    they're diluted into the same media they are 
    already in.  Importantly, this media contains 
    200 µL uracil.
