 1. Place the following items at 4°C overnight:
    
    - >50 mL "rinse buffer" (100 mM CaCl₂)
    - >8 mL "storage buffer" (60 mM CaCl₂, 10 mM 
      Tris, 15% glycerol, pH 7.5)
    - 1 50 mL pipet
    - 1 10 mL pipet
    - >80 PCR tubes
    - tips for aliquoting (repeater is easier)
    - tube rack

 2. Pick a fresh s3 colony and grow overnight in 
    4 mL LB+Tet at 37°C with shaking [1].

 3. Inoculate 100 mL LB+Tet with 1 mL overnight
    culture.

 4. Grow the cells at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm to 
    an OD600 of 0.375 (~1h30).

 5. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min at 4°C.

 6. Gently resuspend the pellet in 50 mL rinse buffer.

 7. Rest the cells on ice for 1h.

 8. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min at 4°C.

 9. Gently resuspend the pellet in 8 mL storage 
    buffer.

10. Rest the cells on ice for 30 min.

11. Aliquot the cells in ~80 100 μL portions.

12. Flash-freeze in N₂(ℓ) and store at -80°C.

Note:
[1] If you want to do the prep in one day, you can 
    pick a colony and grow it in 2 mL LB+Tet until it 
    reaches log phase (probably 5-6 h, but variable) 
    instead of doing an overnight culture.
