2-fragment Golden Gate
**********************

2021/10/28:

In :expt:`136`, I have been unable to assemble 4 fragments into a combined B1H 
plasmid.  To try simplifying things even more, I'm going to try the assembly 
with only 2 fragments.  This will leave out some of the terminators I'd 
intended to include to maximally insulate the reporter, but those may not be 
necessary, and it might be easier to add them in subsequent steps anyways.

- No colonies for any of the constructs

After failing to get any colonies, I ran a gel of the DNA fragments that had 
gone into the assembly:

- All 4 fragments seem very clean.

- The f136-138 bands are faint because there was very little of each left, 
  maybe ≈0.1 µL.  So I just ran all of it, and this is what I got.
