Observations:

- The control didn't work well this time, compared to :expt:`41`.  
  Specifically, the negative control (AAA target) grew quite well in the 
  selective condition.  The cells also grew 10-20x better in the permissive 
  condition than they had previously.

  - I wonder if there was cross-contamination between my cultures, e.g.  
    because I was using a 24-well block instead of culture tubes.

  - I could sequence the colonies to find out: probably worth doing.

- The single plasmid construct had a range of activities.  Most active was 
  s16/s22, which had the insert before AmpR and no barcode.

- I only had +/âˆ’ barcode constructs for the "before AmpR insert" prepared for 
  this experiment.  Surprisingly, the barcode made a difference: Without it the 
  selection was extremely effective; with it less so.

  - One explanation is that this construct has higher AmpR expression.  The 
    barcode insert includes bidirectional terminators, which in this case 
    prevent the AmpR gene from being included in the Zif268-rpoZ transcript.  
    The strain without this insert should have higher AmpR expression, which 
    could explain why it seems healthier.  See :expt:`161` for more on this 
    idea.

- I can't really understand why inserting the Zif268-rpoZ gene into the f1 ori 
  would be substantially better than inserting it between the f1 ori and the 
  pSC101 ORI.  I want to sequence and/or repeat things before I read too much 
  into this.

Next steps:

- Sequence colonies
- Repeat with all constructs: are results reproducible?

==========
Today I'm going to repeat the experiment with only the controls and s16/s22.  
My hope is that doing the experiment with fewer samples (and using individual 
culture tubes) will give better results.

Observations:

- The controls worked well this time.  I suspect the problem with the previous 
  experiment was contamination.

- s16 actually performed better than the controls: you can see that the 
  colonies are bigger (although still not quite as big as the positive 
  control).  This could be a sign that even in the original constructs, the 
  antibiotic resistance gene is not being expressed highly enough.

- Reverse pipetting (which I used on the s16/s22 selective plate) completely 
  eliminated the "splash colonies" that are visible on every other plate.

- I did the image analysis differently, most significantly (i) subtracting 
  background signal and (ii) setting contrast based on the number of saturated 
  pixels.  I think this makes it a lot easier to see/compare the colonies.

Nest steps:

- I'm hesitant to repeat this assay with lots of samples again, because it was 
  difficult and I might have contamination again.  But I want to retest the 
  constructs with Zif268 inserted after/within f1.  I'll either do that in 
  smaller batches with this assay, or perhaps all at once with the plate reader 
  assay (once I've analyzed the data and decided whether or not to trust it).
