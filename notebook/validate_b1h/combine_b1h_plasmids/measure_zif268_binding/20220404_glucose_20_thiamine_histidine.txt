1. Prepare 50 mL 200 mg/mL (20% w/v) glucose:
   
   - 10 g glucose
   - water to 50 mL
   - sterile filter (0.2 µm)

2. Prepare 50 mL 1 mg/mL thiamine-HCl [1]:
   
   - 50 mg thiamine
   - 50 mL water
   - sterile filter (0.2 µm)

3. Prepare 50 mL 100 mM histidine:
   
   - 575.75 mg L-histidine
   - water to 50 mL
   - mix well to fully dissolve
   - sterile filter (0.2 µm)

Notes:
[1] I make this recipe with "hydrated" thiamine.  
    The degree of hydration is unknown, so this is 
    not particularly accurate.

[2] Sigma H6034.  According to the label, 
    solubility is 50 mg/mL = 322 mM.
