$ sw b1h/plate_assay s4 s5 s16 s22

1. Grow overnight cultures [1]:

   LB+Amp: s16,s22
   LB+Amp+Kan: s4,s5

   - Use fresh colonies (i.e. either transformed or
     restreaked within 1 week).
   - Incubate at 37°C overnight with shaking.

2. Grow day cultures:

   - Inoculate 3 mL LB+Amp/LB+Amp+Kan with 30 µL
     saturated overnight culture.
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking until OD≈0.4
     (5-6h)

3. Wash cells with minimal media:

   - Repeat 4x:
     - Spin 3500g, 3 min, 4°C.
     - Resuspend in 1 mL NM.
   - Dilute to OD=0.1

4. Perform a serial dilution [2]:

   - Put 100.00 μL 0.1 OD cells in a tube.
   - Put 90.00 μL NM in 5 adjacent tubes.
   - Transfer 10.00 μL between each tube to make 6
     10-fold dilutions.

5. Plate 5 µL of each dilution in triplicate on
   permissive/selective plates with the appropriate
   antibiotics.

   - Don't draw a grid on the plate directly.  It
     makes it hard to count colonies.  Instead, place
     a guide underneath the plate and spot based on
     that.

Notes:
[1] [Noyes2008] uses 2xYT instead of LB.  I don't
    think this detail matters, although the cells may
    grow faster in richer media.

[2] The final concentrations will be:
    1  1.000000e-01 OD
    2  1.000000e-02 OD
    3  1.000000e-03 OD
    4  1.000000e-04 OD
    5  1.000000e-05 OD
    6  1.000000e-06 OD
