$ sw recipes/histidine

1. Prepare 50 mL 100 mM histidine [1]:
   - 775.75 mg L-histidine
   - water to 50 mL
   - mix well to fully dissolve
     - Last time I tried to make this, I couldn't 
       get the histidine to dissolve.  I think I 
       might need to adjust the pH...
   - sterile filter (0.2 Âµm)

Note:
[1] Sigma H6034.  According to the label, 
    solubility is 50 mg/mL = 322 mM.
