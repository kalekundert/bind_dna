- p184/p187 had the most colonies (especially p184), but very few had the 
  insert at all.

- p185/p188 had colonies with the insert, but the amplicon is must too short.  
  I'm curious to know what's going on here.

- p186/p189 had the fewest colonies, but almost every one had the expected 
  insert.

Plan:

- I'll pick colonies for every plasmid except p184.  I want to sequence 
  p185,p187,p188 to see what's going on.  I can send p186/p189 directly for 
  plasmid sequencing.  In fact, I might just send them all for plasmid 
  sequencing to just know what's going on.  It could be hard to interpret the 
  Sanger results for p185/p187/p188.
