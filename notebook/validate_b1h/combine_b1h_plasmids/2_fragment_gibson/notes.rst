- p184/p187 had the most colonies (especially p184), but very few had the 
  insert at all.

- p185/p188 had colonies with the insert, but the amplicon is must too short.  
  I'm curious to know what's going on here.

- p186/p189 had the fewest colonies, but almost every one had the expected 
  insert.

2021/11/17:

I sent 1 plasmid from each reaction for complete sequencing:

- All 5 assemblies were correct, even though p185, p187, and p188 all had the 
  wrong-length amplicon.

- The specific p185 colony I picked has a point mutation near the TGG target 
  site.  This mutation eliminates the NotI site that I'd use to replace the 
  target site (although the Zif268-rpoZ cassette also introduces a NotI site 
  I'd need to eliminate).
