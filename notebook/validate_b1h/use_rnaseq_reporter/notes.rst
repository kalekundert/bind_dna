*******************
Use RNAseq reporter
*******************

Another way to which protein/target pairs are functional in a B1H assay is 
using RNAseq:

- Express a transcript with a barcode identifying the protein and the target
- Reverse-transcribe and sequence the transcript.

This does not require any selection, although it might be convenient with the 
URA3/HIS3 or GFP reporter.  It also promises high throughput, since I should be 
able to easily cover a library of ≈10⁸.
