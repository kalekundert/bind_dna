Measure growth rate
*******************

For many of my experiments, I want to grow my cells to log phase.  However, I 
don't know where that is, because:

- There doesn't seem to be any correspondence between the OD measurements made 
  by (i) the nanodrop in pedestal mode, (ii) the nanodrop in cuvette mode, and 
  (iii) the plate reader.

- I don't know if my âˆ’rpoZ strain is bigger or smaller than "regular" E.  coli.  
  The size of the cells affects the relationship between A600 and cell 
  population.

To address this, I want to grow cells and, at regular intervals, measure OD and 
cfu/mL.

Roadmap
=======
- [ ] Pick strain
- [x] Plan experiment
- [ ] Do experiment

Considerations
==============
- LB and NM media

- At regular intervals:

  - Make dilutions
  - Measure OD on all instruments
  - Plate cells to measure cfu/mL

- Wait for AmpR to be fixed?  That could affect things.

  - I should do that experiment early next week.  I could then just use 
    whichever strain has the best AmpR promoter.
