Optimize sequencing primers

2021/08/31:

I've been having trouble getting reliable sequencing data for my HIS3/URA3 B1H 
plasmids.  I suspect that the sequencing primers I chose might be the reason.

Observations:

- o251 appears to be the best primer.

  Of the two primers with no detectable nonspecific amplification, it gave the 
  most specific amplification.

- I think it's likely that my sequencing troubles have been related to the o247 
  primer.

- I did load slightly less of the o247 reaction onto the gel, just because 
  there was a little bubble in the pipet tip.  But it definitely wasn't enough 
  to account for the different in signal between that primer and the others.
