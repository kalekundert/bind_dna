Compare target promoters
************************

One factor that may be limiting the dynamic range of the qPCR assay is the 
leaky expression of the reporter.  Here I want to:

- Measure leaky expression, e.g. by measuring target mRNA levels in the absence 
  of any DBD.

- Try alternative promoters that may have less leaky expression.
