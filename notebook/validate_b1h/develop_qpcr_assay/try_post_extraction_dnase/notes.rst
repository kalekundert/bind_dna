Try post-extraction DNase
*************************

It is possible to perform a DNase treatment step after extracting total RNA, 
then to remove the DNase before reverse transcription.  The removal is the 
important part, since it's easy to just add DNase.  I found two kits that exist 
for this purpose (although to be honest, I can't tell the difference between 
them):

- https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1906
- https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K2981

In this experiment, I want to see if these kits improve my signal-to-noise 
ratio.

The ezDNase I use in :expt:`172` pretty much fulfills this role, so I'm not 
planning to look more closely into this for now.
