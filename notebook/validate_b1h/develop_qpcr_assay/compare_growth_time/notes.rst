In :expt:`172`, I saw that two cultures with different densities gave 
significantly fold changes.  I'm not convinced that the difference isn't a 
fluke, but if it's not, the difference in culture density is the best 
explanation I currently have.

The purpose of this experiment is to test this idea more carefully.
