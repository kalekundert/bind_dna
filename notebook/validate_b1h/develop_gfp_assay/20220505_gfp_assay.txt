1. Grow 1 mL overnight cultures of sz221-sz228 in
   LB+Carb at 37°C for 16h [1].

2. Inoculate day cultures:

   - 1 mL LB + Carb + 10 µM IPTG
   - 10 µL overnight culture
   - Reserve some media for making serial dilutions
     later.

3. Grow day cultures at 37°C to late log phase [2].

4. Wash 100 µL cells from each culture with PBS [3]:

   - Repeat 2x:
     - Spin 3500g, 3 min, 4°C
     - Resuspend in 100 µL PBS

5. Perform a serial dilution [4]:

   - Put 127.46 µL 1 x day culture in a tube.
   - Put 100.00 µL LB+Carb+IPTG in 3 adjacent tubes.
   - Transfer 27.46 µL between each tube to make 4
     4.6-fold dilutions.

6. Prepare a plate for fluorescence measurement:

   - Use a black, opaque-bottom plate.
   - Add:
     - 150 µL PBS
     - 50 µL washed/diluted cells
   - Pipet to mix.

7. Measure the following using a plate reader:

   - mWasabi: 493/509 nm ex/em
   - mCherry: 587/610 nm ex/em

Notes:
[1] The small culture size is meant to reduce the
    chance of cross-contamination when using 24-well
    blocks.

[2] I don't know exactly what OD represents late log
    phase.  I'll have to do an experiment to figure
    that out.

[3] This is necessary because the yeast extract in LB
    is highly fluorescent:

    1  1.000000e+00 x
    2  2.154435e-01 x
    3  4.641589e-02 x
    4  1.000000e-02 x
