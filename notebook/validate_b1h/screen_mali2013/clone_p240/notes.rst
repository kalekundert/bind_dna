- Got 5 colonies

- Amplicon does not match expected size, but I've seen the same thing 
  previously with plasmids that ended up having the correct sequence.  I still 
  don't know what was happening with that, or if it could be happening here, 
  but I want to submit colony #4 for plasmid sequencing.

- Got 15 colonies.

- Amplicons look the same as before.

- Overlap extension PCR product isn't clean, but should be easy to purify.

- I don't know why there are persistently bands at 800 bp.

  - If f192 were to circularize, the o3/o358 amplicon would be 489 bp.

  - If p2 (pUC19) were to somehow be in the sample, the o3/o358 amplicon would 
    be 1152bp.

  - The negative control is clean, but I don't have a +cell, −plasmid control.

  - Snapgene doesn't find any alternative binding site for either of these 
    primers.

  - The Tm difference between these two primers (according to the NEB Tm 
    calculator) is larger than the recommended 5°C, so it may be that one of 
    the primers is binding semi-nonspecifically at the annealing temperature 
    used for the reaction.

- I will miniprep and sequence colonies #2 and #8.
