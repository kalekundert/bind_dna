$ sw pour_245mm_plate

1. Prepare 300 mL LB-agar per plate:

   - 300 mL water
   - 11.1 g LB-agar

2. Autoclave at 121°C for 45 min.

3. Let cool to ≈55°C.

4. Add 1x carbenicillin.

5. Pour into a 245x245 mm plate.

6. Let cool with cracked lid for 1h at room
   temperature [1].

7. Invert and keep at room temperature overnight.

8. Store at 4°C for up to 3 months.

Note:
[1] I don't think I adequately dried the plates the
    last time I did this: large drops condensed on
    the surface of both the plate I used immediately
    and the plate I stored at 4°C.  On the plate I
    used immediately, the drops caused the cells to
    smear.  I should either dry the plates longer
    before using them, or dry them in a hood.
