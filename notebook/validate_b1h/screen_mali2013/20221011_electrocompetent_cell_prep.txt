1. Prepare the following:
   
   - Make 1L "low salt" SOB:
   
      - 20g bacto-tryptone (2% w/v final)
      - 5g bacto-yeast extract (0.5% w/v final)
      - 2 mL 5M NaCl (10 mM final)
      - 833.3 μL 3M KCl (2.5 mM final)
      - milliQ water to 1L
      - pH to 7.0 with NaOH
      - autoclave 30 min, 121°C (cycle #5)
   
   - Place the following items at 4°C overnight:
   
      - 700 mL milliQ water
      - 240 mL 10% glycerol (30 mL 80% glycerol, milliQ 
        water to 240 mL, sterile filter)
      - 8 50 mL falcon tubes
      - >3 50 mL pipets
      - 1 box 1000 μL pipet tips
      - 1 box 200 μL pipet tips
      - 60 0.6 mL tubes (autoclaved)
      - tube rack
   
   - Pick a colony and grow overnight in 10 mL SOB at 
     37°C with shaking.

2. Prepare electrocompetent cells:
   
   - Inoculate 1L SOB with 1 mL overnight culture.  
     Keep 1 mL to use as a blank.
   
   - Grow at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm to an OD600 
     of 0.4 (~4h).
   
   - Distribute the cells between 4 250 mL centrifuge 
     tubes and balance them.
   
   - Place the cells in an ice bath for 10 min to 
     quickly bring them to 4°C.  For the rest of the 
     prep, keep the cells at 4°C.
   
   - Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.
   
   - Rinse and resuspend each pellet in 100 mL 
     pre-chilled water, then distribute the cells 
     between 8 pre-chilled 50 mL falcon tubes.
   
   - Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.
   
   - Resuspend each pellet in 25 mL pre-chilled 
     water, then consolidate the cells into 4 tubes.
   
   - Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.
   
   - Resuspend each pellet in 50 mL pre-chilled 10% 
     glycerol.
   
   - Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.
   
   - Resuspend each pellet in 1 mL pre-chilled 10% 
     glycerol.  The total volume will be ~6 mL.
   
   - Aliquot 100 μL of the competent cells into ~60 
     tubes.
   
   - Freeze immediately in N₂ (ℓ) and store at -80°C.
