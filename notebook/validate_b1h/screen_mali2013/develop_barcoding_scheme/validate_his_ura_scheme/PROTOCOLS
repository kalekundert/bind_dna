The library cloning steps for this experiment use a number of new protocols 
that I'd eventually like to incorporate into stepwise:

l3, l4: "oligo-pool-pcr"

  - Base this off of Twist protocol
  - Calculate number of cycles from length of oligos.
  - Add step about running gel, doing extra steps if band is too faint.

p240: colony-pcr

  - Infer expected band size from product.

p237, p239, p241: electrotransform

  - Read protocols, find similarities
  - Include purification step in beginning?

f186, f190, f195, f196: gel-purify

  - Infer expected band size from product.
