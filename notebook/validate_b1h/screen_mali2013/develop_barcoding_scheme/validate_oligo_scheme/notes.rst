Validate oligo scheme
*********************

The idea behind this barcoding scheme is to include two barcodes with each 
DBD/target oligo.

Advantages:

- The barcodes don't have to have the same sequence, eliminating any sequence 
  duplication.

Disadvantages:

- The barcodes in this scheme will probably take up more space than any of the 
  other schemes.

Notes
=====
- I think the barcodes and the DBD/target have to be interleaved in the final 
  assembly.

Approaches
==========
.. figure:: oligo_cloning_ori_with_target.svg

  ORI with target.

.. figure:: oligo_cloning_ori_with_dbd.svg

  ORI with DBD

- I don't have any reason to suspect that either architecture would work better 
  or worse than the other.

- Putting the ORI with the target complicates cloning, and doesn't really 
  appreciably make room the protein sequence.
