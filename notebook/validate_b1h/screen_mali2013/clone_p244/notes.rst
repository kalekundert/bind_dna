- One of the BsaI sites in f202 seems to be missing:

  - I expected bands at 2.8, 1.1, and 0.9 kb.

  - I see 7 bands.  The brightest are at 2.8 and 2.0 kb.  I suspect that the 
    2.0 kb band is the result of the site between the 1.1 and 0.9 bands not 
    being cut.

  - If my suspicion is correct, this isn't a big problem.  The only purpose of 
    that site was to increase the separation between the band I want (2.8 kb) 
    and the ones I don't.  It's still disconcerting, though.

- Something seems wrong with f203, but I'm not sure what:

  - I expected bands at 4.1 and 0.2 kb.

  - Instead, I see 5 bands.  None of them are *clearly* the right band, and 
    most of them I have no explanation for.

- Lyophilization doesn't seem to have any substantial effect on the gel 
  purification.

- I'm going to sequence my plasmids and the bands I recovered to (hopefully) 
  figure out what's going on.
