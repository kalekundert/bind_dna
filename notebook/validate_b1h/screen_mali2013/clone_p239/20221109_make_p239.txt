$ sw make p239

1. Setup 2 ligation reactions:

   - Use the following reagents:

     f191: +, -

   - Make master mix:

     Reagent              Stock   Volume    ≈8.6x
     ────────────────────────────────────────────
     T4 ligase buffer       10x  0.30 µL  2.57 µL
     T4 DNA ligase     400 U/µL  0.15 µL  1.29 µL
     f190              19 ng/µL  0.12 µL  1.00 µL
     ────────────────────────────────────────────
                                 0.57 µL  4.86 µL

   - Setup the reactions:

     Reagent         Stock   Volume
     ──────────────────────────────
     master mix             0.57 µL
     f191        0.2 ng/µL  2.43 µL
     ──────────────────────────────
                            3.00 µL

   - Mix all reagents on ice, so the reaction doesn't
     start before all of the fragments have been
     added.

2. Incubate at the following temperatures:

   - 25°C for 15 min
   - 65°C for 10 min

3. Label the product: p239

4. Desalt and concentrate the DNA using a spin 
   column.
   
   - Elute in the smallest possible volume.

5. Transform the DNA into NEB 10-beta cells by 
   electroporation.  For each transformation:
   
   - Pre-warm 1 mL NEB 10-beta/stable outgrowth 
     medium and a selective plate.
   
   - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 1 μL DNA on 
     ice.  
   
   - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
     ~10 min.
   
   - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
     load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
   
   - Shock at 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF.  The decay time 
     should be 4.8-5.1 ms (for cuvettes with a 1 mm 
     gap).
   
   - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed medium.  If 
     you're transforming multiple aliquots of cells 
     with the same DNA, combine them.
   
   - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
     
   - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
     from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
     transformed.
   
   - Plate remaining cells on a large plate [1].
   
     24x24 cm plates:
     - 10⁵ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 500 µL.
     - Resuspend in 2x 5 mL LB.
   
     10x10 cm plates:
     - 10⁴ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 100 µL.
   
     Spread cells using beads.

6. Midiprep.

7. Send p239 to Quintara for Sanger sequencing:

   Sanger primers: o2,o401

   Prepare the samples:

   - ≤10 kb
   - 80 ng/µL
   - 10 µL/rxn

   Prepare the primers:

   - 5 µM
   - 5 µL/rxn
