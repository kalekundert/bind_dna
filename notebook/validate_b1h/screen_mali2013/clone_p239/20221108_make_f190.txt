$ sw make f190

1. Setup 1 digestion:

   Reagent               Stock     Volume
   ──────────────────────────────────────
   water                        177.89 µL
   p238              133 ng/µL   37.59 µL
   rCutSmart buffer        10x   25.00 µL
   BbsI-HF             20 U/µL    5.00 µL
   Quick CIP            5 U/µL    4.52 µL
   ──────────────────────────────────────
                                250.00 µL

   - Split the reaction into 3 tubes with 83.3 µL
     each.

2. Run the following thermocycler protocol:

   - 37°C for 120m
   - 65°C for 20m

3. Label the product: f190

4. Purify using QIAquick PCR purification kit (28104)
   [1,2]:

   - Perform all spin steps at 17900g.
   - Add 5 volumes PB to the crude DNA.
   - If not yellow: Add 0.2 volumes 3M sodium
     acetate, pH=5.0.
   - Load on a QIAquick column.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.

   - Add 750 µL PE.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.
   - Spin 1m; discard flow-through.
   - Add 40.0 µL EB.
   - Wait at least 1m.
   - Spin 30s; keep flow-through.

5. Prepare 1 sample for electrophoresis:

   Reagent      Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────────
   f186                40.00 µL
   loading dye     6x   8.00 µL
   ────────────────────────────
                       48.00 µL

6. Run a gel:

   gel: 1% agarose
   buffer: 0.5x tris-acetate
   ladder: 10 µL 50 ng/µL 1kb+ DNA ladder
   samples: 48 µL/lane
   run: 100V for 80 min

7. Stain gel with GelGreen [3-5]:

   - Keep the stain protected from light.

   - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 1x GelGreen, 1x running
     buffer.
   - Shake gently for 30m.

8. Purify the desired band using the QIAEX II kit:

   - Cut the 3.2kb band out of the gel.

   - Add 3 volumes QX1.
   - Add 30 µL QIAEX II beads.
     - Resuspend the beads by vortexing for 30s.
   - Incubate at 50°C for 10 min.
     - Vortex every 2 min to keep the beads
       suspended.
     - If the solution is not yellow after the
       agarose dissolves, add 10 µL 3M sodium acetate
       pH=5 and continue incubating for at least 5
       min.
   - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

   - Add 500 µL QX1.
   - Vortex to resuspend the pellet.
   - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

   - Repeat 2x:
     - Add 500 µL PE.
     - Vortex to resuspend the pellet.
     - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

   - Air-dry the pellet for 30 min.

   - Add 20 µL EB.
   - Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
   - Centrifuge for 30s.  Transfer supernatant to a
     clean tube.

[4] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

[5] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.
