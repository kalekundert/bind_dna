 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [3]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 80°C for 20 min

 3. Label the product: f186

 4. Prepare 1 sample for electrophoresis:

    Reagent      Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────
    f186                56.67 µL
    loading dye     6x   2.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────
                        58.67 µL

 5. Run a gel:

    gel: 0.5% agarose
    buffer: 0.5x tris-acetate
    ladder: 5 µL 1kb+ DNA ladder
    samples: 12 µL/lane
    run: 100V for 40 min

 6. Stain gel with GelGreen [4-6]:

    - Keep the stain protected from light.

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 3x GelGreen, 100 mM
      NaCl.
    - Shake gently for 30m.

 7. Purify the desired band using the freeze-and-
    squeeze method [7]:

    - Cut the 2.4kb band out of the gel.
    - Equilibrate gel slice in 2x PBS [8] for 30 min
      at room temperature, in the dark.  Use at least
      10x the volume of the gel slice.
    - Transfer gel slice to clean tube.
    - Flash-freeze with liquid nitrogen.
    - Immediately move the gel into a Spin-X column
      and centrifuge for 10 min at max speed
      (≈21,000g) [9].
    - Measure DNA recovery by Nanodrop.
    - Desalt and concentrate using a silica spin
      column.

 8. Setup 1 ligation reaction [10]:

    Reagent              Stock   Volume
    ───────────────────────────────────
    T4 ligase buffer       10x  0.50 µL
    T4 DNA ligase     400 U/µL  0.25 µL
    f186              20 ng/µL  1.72 µL
    f187               1 ng/µL  2.53 µL
    ───────────────────────────────────
                                5.00 µL

 9. Incubate at the following temperatures:

    - 25°C for 15 min
    - 65°C for 10 min

10. Label the product: p237

11. Desalt and concentrate the DNA using a spin 
    column.
    
    - Elute in the smallest possible volume.

12. Transform the DNA into NEB 10-beta cells by 
    electroporation.  For each transformation:
    
    - Pre-warm 1 mL NEB 10-beta/stable outgrowth 
      medium and a selective plate.
    
    - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 1 μL DNA on 
      ice.  
    
    - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
      ~10 min.
    
    - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
      load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
    
    - Shock at 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF.  The decay time 
      should be 4.8-5.1 ms (for cuvettes with a 1 mm 
      gap).
    
    - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed medium.  If 
      you're transforming multiple aliquots of cells 
      with the same DNA, combine them.
    
    - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
      
    - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
      from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
      transformed.
    
    - Plate remaining cells on a large plate [11].
    
      24x24 cm plates:
      - 10⁵ colonies per plate
      - Dilute cells to 500 µL.
    
      10x10 cm plates:
      - 10⁴ colonies per plate
      - Dilute cells to 100 µL.

13. Miniprep.

 [2] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA
     (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume
     should not exceed 10% of the total reaction
     volume to prevent star activity due to excess
     glycerol.

 [3] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if
     the DNA will be purified before use.

 [5] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
     enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
     precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

 [6] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
     Store staining solution at room temperature
     protected from light.

 [8] Neutral pH and high salt (300 mM) are both
     somewhat important.  Sodium acetate (NaAc) is
     slightly better than sodium chloride (NaCl), but
     I only have NaAc with pH=5.2, while my PBS is
     pH=7.4.

 [9] Using a filter is not necessary, but improves
     yields by 10-20%.
