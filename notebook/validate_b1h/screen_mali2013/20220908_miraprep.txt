1. Purify plasmid by miraprep [1]:
   
   - Setup a 50 mL bacterial culture in appropriate 
     selective media and incubate on a shaker (250 
     rpm) at 37°C overnight.
   
   - Transfer bacteria to a 50 mL Falcon tube and 
     spin at 3270g at 4°C for 20 min.
   
   - Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 2 mL 
     resuspension buffer (P1) with 50 μg/mL RNase (5 
     μL 20 mg/mL) freshly added.
   
   - Add 2 mL of lysis buffer (P2), invert 3-4 times 
     and incubate for 3 min at RT.
   
   - Add 2 mL of neutralization buffer (N3) and 
     invert 3-4 times.
   
   - Distribute lysate into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes 
     (~4 tubes) by pouring, not pipetting.
   
   - Spin at >13,200g at RT for 10 min.
   
   - Collect supernatants in a 15 mL tube and discard 
     pellets.
   
   - Add 1x volume of 96% ethanol (~5 mL).
   
   - Mix thoroughly for 5 sec.
   
   - Load the sample-ethanol mix onto 4 spin-columns.  
   
   - Wash with 500 µL washing buffer (PE).
   
   - Wash with 500 μL washing buffer (PE) again.
   
   - Spin at >13,200g at RT for 1.5 min to remove 
     residual ethanol.
   
   - Add 30-35 µL of ddH2O to each spin-column and 
     incubate for 2 min at RT.
   
   - Spin at >13,200g for 2 min to elute the DNA 
     (into a fresh tube).
   
   - Combine the eluted DNA from all 4 columns in one 
     tube (~140 µL).
   
   - Measure DNA concentration.
   
   - Store samples at -20°C.
