$ sw make p243

1. Setup 1 ligation reaction [1]:

   Reagent              Stock   Volume
   ───────────────────────────────────
   T4 ligase buffer       10x  0.50 µL
   T4 DNA ligase     400 U/µL  0.25 µL
   f200               9 ng/µL  3.15 µL
   f201              45 ng/µL  1.10 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────
                               5.00 µL

2. Incubate at the following temperatures:

   - 25°C for 15 min
   - 65°C for 10 min

3. Label the product: p243

4. Desalt and concentrate the DNA using a spin 
   column.
   
   - Elute in the smallest possible volume.

5. Transform the DNA into NEB 10-beta cells by 
   electroporation.  For each transformation:
   
   - Pre-warm 1 mL NEB 10-beta/stable outgrowth 
     medium and a selective plate.
   
   - Dry the selective plate for 10m in a laminar
     flow hood [3].
   
   - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 1 μL DNA on 
     ice.  
   
   - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
     ~10 min.
   
   - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
     load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
   
   - Shock at 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF.  The decay time 
     should be 4.8-5.1 ms (for cuvettes with a 1 mm 
     gap).
   
   - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed medium.  If 
     you're transforming multiple aliquots of cells 
     with the same DNA, combine them.
   
   - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
     
   - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
     from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
     transformed.
   
   - Plate remaining cells on a large plate [2].
   
     24x24 cm plates:
     - 10⁵ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 500 µL.
     - Resuspend in 2x 5 mL LB.
   
     10x10 cm plates:
     - 10⁴ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 100 µL.
   
     Spread cells using beads.

[3] Still experimenting to find ideal drying time.  
    Without any drying, condensation forms on the 
    plate and the colonies run together.
