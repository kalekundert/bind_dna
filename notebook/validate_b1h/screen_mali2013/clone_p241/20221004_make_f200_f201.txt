    ladder: 10 µL 50 ng/µL 1kb+ DNA ladder
    samples: 60 µL/lane
    run: 100V for 50 min

 7. Stain gel with GelGreen [6-8]:

    - Keep the stain protected from light.

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 3x GelGreen, 100 mM
      NaCl.
    - Shake gently for 30m.

 8. Purify the desired band using the QIAEX II kit:

    - Cut the 900bp band out of the gel.

    - Add 3 volumes QX1.
    - Add 30 µL QIAEX II beads.
      - Resuspend the beads by vortexing for 30s.
    - Incubate at 50°C for 10 min.
      - Vortex every 2 min to keep the beads
        suspended.
      - If the solution is not yellow after the
        agarose dissolves, add 10 µL 3M sodium
        acetate pH=5 and continue incubating for at
        least 5 min.
    - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

    - Add 500 µL QX1.
    - Vortex to resuspend the pellet.
    - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

    - Repeat 2x:
      - Add 500 µL PE.
      - Vortex to resuspend the pellet.
      - Centrifuge for 30s.  Discard supernatant.

    - Air-dry the pellet for 30 min.

    - Add 20 µL EB.
    - Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
    - Centrifuge for 30s.  Transfer supernatant to a
      clean tube.

 9. Setup 1 ligation reaction [9]:

    Reagent              Stock   Volume
    ───────────────────────────────────
    T4 ligase buffer       10x  0.50 µL
    T4 DNA ligase     400 U/µL  0.25 µL
    f200              40 ng/µL  1.96 µL
    f201              60 ng/µL  2.29 µL
    ───────────────────────────────────

10. Incubate at the following temperatures:

    - 25°C for 15 min
    - 65°C for 10 min

11. Label the product: p243

12. Desalt and concentrate the DNA using a spin 
    column.
    
    - Elute in the smallest possible volume.

13. Transform the DNA into NEB 10-beta cells by 
    electroporation.  For each transformation:
    
    - Pre-warm 1 mL NEB 10-beta/stable outgrowth 
      medium and a selective plate.
    
    - Dry the selective plate for 10m in a laminar
      flow hood [11].
    
    - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 1 μL DNA on 
      ice.  
    
    - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
      ~10 min.
    
    - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
      load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
    
    - Shock at 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF.  The decay time 
      should be 4.8-5.1 ms (for cuvettes with a 1 mm 
      gap).
    
    - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed medium.  If 
      you're transforming multiple aliquots of cells 
      with the same DNA, combine them.
    
    - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
      
    - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
      from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
      transformed.
    
    - Plate remaining cells on a large plate [10].
    
      24x24 cm plates:
      - 10⁵ colonies per plate
      - Dilute cells to 500 µL.
      - Resuspend in 2x 5 mL LB.
    
      10x10 cm plates:
      - 10⁴ colonies per plate
      - Dilute cells to 100 µL.
    
      Spread cells using beads.

14. Miniprep.

Notes:
 [2] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA
     (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume
     should not exceed 10% of the total reaction
     volume to prevent star activity due to excess
     glycerol.

 [3] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if
     the DNA will be purified before use.

 [7] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
     enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
     precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

 [8] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
     Store staining solution at room temperature
     protected from light.

[11] Still experimenting to find ideal drying time.  
     Without any drying, condensation forms on the 
     plate and the colonies run together.
