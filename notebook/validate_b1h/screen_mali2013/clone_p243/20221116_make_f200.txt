$ sw make f200

1. Setup 1 digestion:

   Reagent              Stock     Volume
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   water                        71.48 µL
   p239              58 ng/µL   35.00 µL
   rCutSmart buffer       10x   12.50 µL
   Esp3I              10 U/µL    4.10 µL
   Quick CIP           5 U/µL    1.92 µL
   ─────────────────────────────────────
                               125.00 µL

2. Run the following thermocycler protocol:

   - 37°C for 120m
   - 80°C for 20m

3. Run an E-Gel to make sure that the digestion is
   complete, and has the expected bands.

   - The expected bands are 3.4 kb and 20 bp.
   - The Esp3I sites were in the insert of the
     previous reaction.

4. Label the product: f200

5. Purify using QIAquick PCR purification kit (28104)
   [1,2]:

   - Perform all spin steps at 17900g.
   - Add 5 volumes PB to the crude DNA.
   - If not yellow: Add 0.2 volumes 3M sodium
     acetate, pH=5.0.
   - Load on a QIAquick column.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.

   - Add 750 µL PE.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.
   - Spin 1m; discard flow-through.
   - Add 50 µL EB.
   - Wait at least 1m.
   - Spin 30s; keep flow-through.
