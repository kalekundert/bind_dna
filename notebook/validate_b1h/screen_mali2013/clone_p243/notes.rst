Interpreting the sequencing results for the "f203" fragment I purified above:

- f203 has the exact same sequence as p242.

  - Either the BsmBI digestion of p242 failed, or the two fragments from that 
    digestion religated.  Neither is consistent with the fact that I did a gel 
    purification, and had a â‰ˆ900bp band to purify (although the gel was 
    smeary).

    - Would Sanger sequencing of f201 be informative?  It should tell me if the 
      digestion worked, which would distinguish between the two possibilities 
      presented above.

    - Maybe this was another partial digestion.  That could explain why 
      re-ligation happened.

- 

- Next steps:

  - Run PAGE gel of f201 (and p242 digest?)
  - PAGE-purify f201?

  - Sequence f201 and f200?
