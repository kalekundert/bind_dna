Interpreting the sequencing results for the "f203" fragment I purified above:

- f203 has the exact same sequence as p242.

  - Either the BsmBI digestion of p242 failed, or the two fragments from that 
    digestion religated.  Neither is consistent with the fact that I did a gel 
    purification, and had a â‰ˆ900bp band to purify (although the gel was 
    smeary).

    - Would Sanger sequencing of f201 be informative?  It should tell me if the 
      digestion worked, which would distinguish between the two possibilities 
      presented above.

    - Maybe this was another partial digestion.  That could explain why 
      re-ligation happened.

- 

- Next steps:

  - Run PAGE gel of f201 (and p242 digest?)
  - PAGE-purify f201?

  - Sequence f201 and f200?

# 2022/11/14:
# My Sanger sequencing reaction failed, but I don't think that necessarily 
# means that the sequence is wrong.  (Particularly because I got more colonies 
# with the insert than without.)  But here I want to at least check that the 
# digestion looks right.

The f210 PCR reaction didn't produce any product yesterday, so today I did a 
:math:`T_A` optimization:
