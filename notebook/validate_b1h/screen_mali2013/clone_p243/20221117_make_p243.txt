$ sw make p243

1. Setup 2 ligation reactions:

   - Use the following reagents:

     f201: +, −

   - Make master mix:

     Reagent              Stock   Volume     2.2x
     ────────────────────────────────────────────
     T4 ligase buffer       10x  0.50 µL  1.10 µL
     T4 DNA ligase     400 U/µL  0.25 µL  0.55 µL
     f200 (high)       11 ng/µL  3.20 µL  7.03 µL
     ────────────────────────────────────────────
                                 3.95 µL  8.68 µL

   - Setup the reactions:

     Reagent        Stock   Volume
     ─────────────────────────────
     master mix            3.95 µL
     f201        27 ng/µL  1.05 µL
     ─────────────────────────────
                           5.00 µL

   - Mix all reagents on ice, to prevent the reaction
     from starting before all of the fragments have
     been added.

2. Incubate at the following temperatures:

   - 25°C for 15 min
   - 65°C for 10 min

3. Label the product: p243

4. Desalt and concentrate the DNA using a spin 
   column.
   
   - Elute in the smallest possible volume.

5. Transform the DNA into NEB 10-beta cells by 
   electroporation.  For each transformation:
   
   - Pre-warm 1 mL NEB 10-beta/stable outgrowth 
     medium and a selective plate.
   
   - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 1 μL DNA on 
     ice.  
   
   - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
     ~10 min.
   
   - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
     load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.
   
   - Shock at 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF.  The decay time 
     should be 4.8-5.1 ms (for cuvettes with a 1 mm 
     gap).
   
   - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed medium.  If 
     you're transforming multiple aliquots of cells 
     with the same DNA, combine them.
   
   - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
     
   - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
     from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
     transformed.
   
   - Plate remaining cells on a large plate [1].
   
     24x24 cm plates:
     - 10⁵ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 500 µL.
     - Resuspend in 2x 5 mL LB.
   
     10x10 cm plates:
     - 10⁴ colonies per plate
     - Dilute cells to 100 µL.
   
     Spread cells using beads.
