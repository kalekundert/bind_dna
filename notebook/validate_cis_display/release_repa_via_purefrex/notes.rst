Release repA via PUREfrex
*************************

I think the aggregation problem I've been seeing with this technique might be 
because too much protein is being expressed.  A simple way to test this is to 
try the reaction with PUREfrex1.0, which gives a much lower level of 
expression.

Compare this experiment to :expt:`36` (2021/02/03).

.. protocol:: 20210506_repa_display.txt

Observations:

- I don't see any mWasabi expression.

- I also don't see any of the mWasabi DNA shifted into the "bound" band.  I see 
  a small amount of the âˆ’mWasabi DNA shifted, but it's hard to know if it's 
  significant.

Conclusions:

- The simplest explanation for this data is simply that there wasn't enough 
  protein expression.
