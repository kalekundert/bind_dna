- Run 1% [1] agarose gel.

  - Image to make sure the separation is good.

- Transfer DNA to a membrane [2,3]:

  - Soak the gel in the following solutions for 
    15-30 min each (with gentle rocking):
    - 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH
    - 3.0 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris HCl (pH 7.0)

  - Wet a HyBond N+ membrane in distilled water [4].

  - Soak 6 sheets (4 regular, 2 large) of Whatman 
    3MM paper in 20x SCC until fully wet [4].

  - Assemble a downward capillary [2] transfer 
    sandwich.  The layers are listed from top to 
    bottom; start from the bottom:

    - light-weight cover (e.g. a gel plate)
    - 2 sheets Whatman 3MM paper (wet) extending 
      into a reservoir of 20x SCC
    - 3 sheets Whatman 3MM paper (wet)
    - gel (wet, skirted with plastic wrap) [5]
    - membrane (wet)
    - 1 sheet Whatman 3MM paper (wet)
    - 4 sheets Whatman 3MM paper (dry)
    - 2-3 cm paper towels (dry) in a container

    Gently roll each layer to remove bubbles.

  - Allow DNA to transfer for 1h.

  - Image to check that no DNA remains in the gel.

  - Rinse membrane in 2x SSC for 10-20 min.

- Fix DNA to membrane:

  - Expose membrane to short-wave (254 nm) UV light 
    for 30-300 sec [6].

Footnotes:
[1] To get the best transfer, use the lowest 
    percentage gel that still gives adequate 
    separation.  Gels below â‰ˆ0.7% are very fragile, 
    though, and may require a base layer of 
    higher-percentage agarose for easier handling.

[4] Soak the membrane and the filter paper by 
    floating on the surface of the buffer and 
    allowing to submerge.  This helps avoid air 
    bubbles, which would lead to uneven transfer.

[5] Do not disturb the gel once it has been placed 
    on the membrane; the DNA begins transferring 
    immediately and moving the gel can cause smears.

[6] The duration of UV exposure should be optimized 
    using dot-blotted dilutions of DNA [3].  An 
    alternative to UV crosslinking is to transfer 
    onto a positively charged nylon membrane using 
    an alkaline (rather than saline) buffer [3].
