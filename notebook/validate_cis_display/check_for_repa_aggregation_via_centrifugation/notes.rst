Check for repA aggregation via centrifugation
*********************************************

One explanation for the gel shifts I've observed while trying to do CIS-display 
(:expt:`36`) is that proteins are just non-specifically aggregating.  If this 
were the case, I might be able to avoid it by performing the reaction at a 
cooler temperature or using less template.  First, however, I'd like a way to 
know if aggregation is even happening.

Right now I can only think of one way to test for aggregation: centrifuge the 
reaction, resuspend the pellet, and compare the pellet to the supernatant via 
SDS PAGE.  My concern is that I won't be able to precipitate anything, because 
I never see any visible precipitate.  So this experiment is a little bit of a 
gamble: If I can get a pellet, it could be informative.  Otherwise, I won't 
learn anything.

Considerations
==============

Centrifuge parameters
---------------------
To get a point of reference for how long/fast I might need to centrifuge, I 
looked for protocols for isolating ribosomes.  I figured that my aggregates 
might not be much larger than ribosomes, so I might need to spin for a 
comparable amount of time.  I found [Rivera2015]_, which calls for spinning at 
100,000g for 16h, which a sucrose cushion/gradient.  I don't plan on using 
sucrose, so I could probably go a little slower, but I don't think these speeds 
are practical.  I'd probably need to buy special tubes capable of withstanding 
that speed while still holding very small volumes, which may not even exist.

I'm inclined to just go top speed in a table-top centrifuge for 1h.  I think 
that's about as much as I can reasonably do.
