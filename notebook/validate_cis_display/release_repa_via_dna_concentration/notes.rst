Release repA via DNA concentration
**********************************

The "aggregation" I've been observing could be due to each DNA molecule being 
translated many times.  If this were the case, one way to address it would be 
to dramatically increase the amount of DNA in the reaction, such the it becomes 
unlikely for any one template to be translated multiple times.  (Note that it 
would also be possible in theory to decrease the ribosome concentration, but in 
practice that would be hard to do without messing up the PUREfrex reaction.)
