Make DNA via miniprep
*********************

Mini/midipreps are an appealing way to prepare DNA for this experiment, because 
they produce larger quantities of DNA than PCR.  But the DNA is unlabeled.  One 
scalable way to render the DNA visible is:

- Digest the plasmid to make it roughly the same size as the PCR product.
- Mix in a small amount of labeled PCR product.

Strictly speaking, the size of the "dark" DNA doesn't matter, but I'd be more 
comfortable if it was similar to the "light" DNA.
