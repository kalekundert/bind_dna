For each 10 µL IVTT reaction:

1. Wash 2 μL magnetic Strep-tactin beads (40 μL 5% 
   bead solution).  Keep washed beads on ice.

2. Dilute the reaction to 50 μL with wash buffer.

3. Save 10 μL "crude" aliquot.

4. Add remaining 40 μL to washed beads.  Vortex to 
   resuspend.

5. Incubate on ice for 30 min.  Vortex every 5 min.

6. Wash three times with wash buffer:

   - First wash: 50 μL buffer
   - Save 10 μL "wash" aliquot.
   - Second wash: 200 μL buffer
   - Third wash: 200 μL buffer

7. Elute with 50 μL elution buffer.
