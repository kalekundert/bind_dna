- For each reaction to be purified using MagStrep 
  "type3" XT beads:

  - Wash 2 μL beads (40 μL 5% bead solution). Keep 
    washed beads on ice.

  - Dilute the reaction to 60 μL with wash buffer [1].

  - Save 10 μL "crude" aliquot.

  - Add remaining 50 μL to washed beads.  Vortex 
    to resuspend.

  - Incubate on ice for 30 min.  Vortex every 5 min.

  - Apply magnet.  Save 10 µL "flow thru" aliquot, 
    then discard the supernatant.

  - Wash three times with wash buffer:

      - Add 200 µL wash buffer
      - Vortex briefly
      - Apply magnet.
      - Save 10 µL "wash #" aliquot.
      - Discard supernatant.

  - Elute with 50 μL elution buffer, save 10 µL 
    "eluate" aliquot.

Note:

[1] The buffers sold by IBA contain EDTA, which I 
    don't want.  So I'm using buffers that I made 
    without EDTA.
