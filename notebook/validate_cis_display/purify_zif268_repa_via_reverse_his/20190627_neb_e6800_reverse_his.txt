Protocol
========
1. Dilute sample to 100 μL in 10 mM MgOAc or other 
   diluent [1].

2. Apply the diluted reaction mixture to a Amicon 
   Ultracel 0.5 ml-100K spin concentrator (0.5 ml 
   maximum load volume) and centrifuge for 30–60 min 
   at 15,000 x g at 4°C [2].

3. Transfer the flow-thru to a new tube.  Add 0.25 
   volumes Ni-NTA Agarose and mix thoroughly for 
   30-45 min at 4°C to allow His-tagged components to 
   bind the resin.

4. Apply the reaction mixture slurry to an empty 
   Bio-Rad micro-spin column and centrifuge for 2 min 
   at 1500 xg at 4°C.

5. Collect eluate containing purified protein and 
   proceed with experimental analysis.

Notes
=====
[1] We recommend a minimum volume of 100 μl after 
    dilution to minimize losses during purification. 
    If the target will be too dilute after addition 
    of the diluent, we suggest a larger reaction 
    volume be used.  Use of concentrated NaCl to 
    dilute the reaction may help dissociate complexes 
    between the target protein and translation 
    factors. The NaCl will remain, however, after the 
    final elution and downstream applications may 
    require microdialysis. We suggest limiting the 
    final concentration of NaCl to ≤ 400 mM after 
    dilution. Additionally, magnesium acetate should 
    be included to keep [Mg2+] close to 10 mM.

[2] If necessary, higher centrifuged forces can be 
    used to push the mixture through the membrane up 
    to the recommended limit of concentration used.
