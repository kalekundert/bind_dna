 1. Prepare each 10x primer mix:

    Reagent    Conc  Each Rxn
    ─────────────────────────
    water            18.00 μL
    o67      100 μM   1.00 μL
    o40,o3   100 μM   1.00 μL
    ─────────────────────────
                     20.00 μL

 2. Setup 2 PCR reactions and 1 negative control:

    Reagent             Conc  Each Rxn  Master Mix
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                     19.00 μL    57.00 μL
    primer mix           10x   5.00 μL            
    p43            100 pg/µL   1.00 µL     3.00 µL
    Q5 master mix         2x  25.00 µL    75.00 µL
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────
                              50.00 μL    45.00 μL/rxn

 3. Run the following thermocycler protocol:

    - 98°C for 30s
    - Repeat 35x:
      - 98°C for 10s
      - 63°C for 20s
      - 72°C for 30s
    - 72°C for 2 min
    - 4°C hold

 4. Purify DNA using magnetic beads [1].

    - Gently resuspend the bead solution [2].
    - Add 1 volume of bead solution to each sample.
    - Incubate 5 min at RT.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min and discard supernatant.
    - Wash twice:
      - Add 200 µL 70% EtOH.
      - Incubate 30 sec at RT.
      - Apply to magnet and discard ethanol.
    - Air-dry for 4-5 minutes [3].
    - Add any volume of eluant.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min.
    - Transfer ≈95% of the eluant to a clean tube.

 5. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 6. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction by 
    mixing the following reagents at room temperature 
    in the order given [4].

    Reagent              Conc  Each Rxn
    ───────────────────────────────────
    reaction buffer       10x   2.00 μL
    RNase inhibitor   40 U/μL   0.50 μL
    rNTP mix           100 mM   8.00 μL
    HiScribe T7           10x   2.00 μL
    DNA template     50 ng/μL   7.50 μL
    ───────────────────────────────────
                               20.00 μL

 7. Incubate at 37°C (thermocycler) for 2 hours.

 8. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
    RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

 9. Nanodrop to determine the RNA concentration.

10. Dilute (if desired) enough RNA to make several 
    10 μM aliquots and to run a gel.  Keep any left- 
    over RNA undiluted.  Flash-freeze in liquid N₂ and 
    store at -80°C.

11. Run the RNA on a denaturing gel to make sure it's 
    homogeneous and of the right size.

Notes:
[1] See "Magnetic Bead DNA Purification" in my Google 
    Drive for more details.

[2] Don't vortex; this damages the beads (somehow).

[3] Be careful not to over-dry the beads.  Over-dried
    beads will appear cracked and will be difficult 
    to resuspend.  If this happens, heat and agitate 
    for 10-15 minutes during elution to help 
    resuspend the beads and release the DNA.  An 
    alternative strategy is to add the eluant after a 
    very short drying step, then leaving the tubes 
    open for 10-15 minutes to allow the ethanol to 
    evaporate.

[4] Cannot reach the recommended 1000.0 ng of DNA,
    using 375.0 ng instead.
