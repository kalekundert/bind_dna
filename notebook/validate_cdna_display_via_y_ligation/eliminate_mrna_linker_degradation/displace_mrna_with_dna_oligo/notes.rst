Displace mRNA with DNA oligo
****************************

I'm suspicious that RNase H contamination is causing the linker to be separated 
from the mRNA, see :expt:`66`.  If this is a problem, one way to solve it would 
be to use a DNA oligo to anneal with the linker instead of the the mRNA, so 
that RNase H would have no RNA/DNA duplex to cleave.  This is similar to the 
:expt:`50` idea I use to assay the ligation reaction.

Below is a basic outline of the experiments I'm considering:

- Try oligo designed to work with linker-N.

- Try modifying linker-N (e.g. shorten the complementarity to the mRNA, add a 
  longer toehold region) to help the DNA oligo bind.  This would be a more 
  significant undertaking.
