1. Perform a serial dilution [1]:

   - Put 35.10 μL 10.00 U/mL RNase H in the first tube.
   - Add 24.00 μL 1x RNase H reaction buffer in the 6 remaining tubes.
   - Transfer 11.10 μL between each tube to make 7
     3.2-fold dilutions.

2. Setup 1 positive control:

   - 10.0 µL 1x RNase H reaction buffer
   -  0.5 µL 5 µM o212

3. Setup 8 negative controls:

   - 10.0 µL RNase H dilution, including 0 U/mL.
   -  0.5 µL 5 µM o211 [1]

4. Setup 8 experimental samples:

   - 10.0 µL RNase H dilution, including 0 U/mL.
   -  0.5 µL 5 µM o210 [1]

5. Incubate at 30°C for 10 min.

6. Setup the following reactions in a black, opaque-
   bottomed 96-well plate:

   Reagent    Stock     Volume       18.7x
   ───────────────────────────────────────
   water              89.30 µL  1669.91 µL
   MgCl₂    1000 mM    0.10 µL     1.87 µL
   o213      100 µM    0.10 µL     1.87 µL
   samples            10.50 µL
   ───────────────────────────────────────
                     100.00 µL    89.50 µL/rxn

7. Measure flourescence (ex: 450, em: 521) in a plate
   reader for 30 min at 30°C without shaking.

Note:
[1] If I could use an Echo, I would add 25 nL of 100 µM 
    o210/o211, to minimize the amount of volume added to 
    the sample.  But I don't think I can accurately 
    pipet less than 0.5 µL by hand.
