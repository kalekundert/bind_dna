 1. Setup 1 XmnI digestion [1]:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    water                        3.50 µL
    p98              200 ng/µL   5.00 µL
    CutSmart Buffer        10x   1.00 µL
    XmnI               20 U/µL   0.50 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                10.00 µL

 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [2]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 65°C for 20 min

 3. Label the product: f42

 4. Purify DNA via phenol-chloroform extraction:

    - Dilute or divide your sample as necessary to 
      ensure that each tube has between 100-700 µL [3].

    - Repeat twice:

      - Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
        alcohol (pH≈8 for DNA) to the tube.

      - Vortex vigorously to mix the phases.
   
      - Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
        separate the phases.
   
      - Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new tube, 
        being careful not to transfer any of the protein 
        at the phase interface.
 
    - Extract the sample with an equal volume of 
      chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove the phenol.

 5. Perform an ethanol precipitation [4,5]:

    - Add sodium acetate, pH=5.2 to 300 mM.
    - Add linear polyacrylamide (LPA) to 20 ng/µL.
    - Add 3 volumes 100% ethanol and mix well.
    - If necessary, divide the sample between
      microfuge tubes such that none holds more than
      400 µL.
    - Centrifuge >7500g, 60 min, 4°C.  Remove the
      supernatant, but save it in case the
      precipitation needs to be repeated.
    - Add 800 µL recently-prepared 70% ethanol [6].
    - Centrifuge >7500g, 2 min, 4°C.  Discard
      supernatant.
    - Centrifuge >7500g, 30 s, 4°C.  Discard any
      remaining supernatant.
    - Leave the tube open at room temperature until
      ethanol has evaporated [7].
    - Resuspend the pellet in 2 µL of nuclease-free
      water [8].

 6. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

    - Load onto a 100 kDa MWCO spin-filter [13].
    - Spin 14000g, 15 min.
    - Wash with 500 µL 8M urea.
    - Wash with 500 µL nuclease-free water.
    - Wash with water again.
    - Wash with water again, but spin for 30 min
      [13].
    - Invert the filter into a clean tube and spin
      1000g, 2 min to collect ligated product in a
      volume of ≈15 µL.

17. Dilute the purified mRNA to 1 µM.

18. Make 4 µL, 1 µM aliquots.

Notes:
 [1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
     (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume 
     should not exceed 10% of the total reaction 
     volume to prevent star activity due to excess 
     glycerol.

 [2] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if 
     the DNA will be purified before use.

 [3] It is difficult to do the extraction with volumes 
     smaller than 100 µL. The sample can be 
     concentrated again after precipitation.

 [5] This protocol was optimized for 100 ng/µL
     nucleic acid.  If your sample is substantially
     more dilute, it may be necessary to compensate
     by increasing the incubation time, the
     centrifugation time, or the centrifugation
     speed.

 [6] Ethanol evaporates more quickly than water, so a
     solution that was 70% ethanol several months ago
     may be significantly more aqueous now.  If you
     are unsure, 100 µL of 70% EtOH should weigh 88.6
     mg.

 [7] Do not dry pellets of nucleic acid in a
     lyophilizer, as this causes denaturation of
     small (<400-nucleotide) fragments of DNA and
     greatly reduces the recovery of larger fragments
     of DNA.

     If necessary, the open tube containing the
     redissolved DNA can be incubated for 2-3 minutes
     at 45°C in a heating block to allow any traces
     of ethanol to evaporate.

 [8] Up to 50% of the DNA is smeared on the wall of
     the tube. To recover all of the DNA, push a bead
     of fluid backward and forward over the
     appropriate quadrant of wall with a pipette tip.

[10] I've found that T7 kits which have been in the 
     freezer for more than ≈4 weeks seem to produce 
     more degraded RNA.

[11] Use a thermocycler to prevent evaporation.

[12] Using 0.6x linker reduces the amount of
     unligated linker, see expt #1.
