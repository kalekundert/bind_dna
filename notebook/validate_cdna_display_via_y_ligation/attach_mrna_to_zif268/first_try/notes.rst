Total failure.  A lot of things could've gone wrong; this was a cowboy 
experiment.  I'll have to step through things more carefully.

- I didn't have urea to use for the ligation cleanup.

- I lost the −mRNA, −linker-N reaction due to SDS precipitation.

- I had to run the remaining reactions through a spin column an extra time to 
  remove KCl from the buffer.  I might have lost things.

- I don't know what the FITC signal at the bottom of the ladder is.

- The signal in the two PURExpress lanes is probably in the green channel only 
  due to crosstalk, and the FITC channel being brighter overall.  The signal is 
  also present in the red channel, although it's hard to see with the green 
  channel superimposed.  Still, it's bizarre that the proteins in the ladder 
  are clearly brighter in the red channel, while the PURExpress proteins are 
  not.

   I noticed that my linker-N doesn't have the reverse transcription primer 
   arm.  This shouldn't have affected this experiment (the puromycin is still 
   there), but I won't be able to progress beyond this step until I get the 
   right linker.  See :expt:`6` for more about this.
