Purify ligated mRNA via biotin
******************************

Dan suggested that the easiest way to separate ligated from unligated mRNA 
might be to include biotin in the linker and to purify with streptavidin beads.  
I would also need a step to exclude free linker.

Considerations
==============
- Zymo spin kits (RNA Clean & Concentrator - 100) claim to be able to control 
  whether RNA >17 nt or >200nt is retained.  Possibly I could use that to get 
  rid of free linker.
