Remove unligated mRNA via PAGE
******************************

2021/05/04:

Given the trouble I've been having with the puromycin coupling reaction, I 
think it might be helpful to start with mRNA that is 100% ligated to the 
linker, e.g. no free mRNA and no free linker.  

In this experiment I'm going to look at PAGE purification, which has been used 
by [Reyes2021]_ and others for this exact purpose.
