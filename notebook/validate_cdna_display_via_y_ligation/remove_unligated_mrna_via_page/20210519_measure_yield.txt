1. Prepare 2 samples for TBE/urea PAGE:

   Reagent          Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────────────
   RNA loading dye     2x   5.00 µL
   f11,f111         10 µM   5.00 µL
   ────────────────────────────────
                           10.00 µL

   - Incubate at 70°C for 3 min.

2. Run a gel:

   gel: 6% TBE/urea PAGE
   buffer: 1x TBE
   ladder: 1 µL low range ssRNA ladder (NEB N0364S)
   samples: 10 µL
   run: 180V for 40 min

3. Cut the desired band out of the gel [1].

   - Place the gel over a TLC plate.
   - Use a UV light to visualize the RNA (dark spot)
   - Consider visualizing remaining gel to ensure
     that all desired RNA was excised.

4. Crush gel slices.

   - Poke 3-4 holes in 0.65 mL tube with 27 g needle.
   - Place gel slice inside 0.65 mL tube.
   - Place 0.65 mL tube inside 1.5 mL tube.
   - Centrifuge 5 min at max speed.

5. Resuspend gel in 400 µL PAGE elution buffer

   - Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 10 mM
   - NaCl 500 mM
   - EDTA 1 mM
   - SDS 0.1%

6. Incubate overnight at room temperature with
   agitation.

   - 4°C would also be ok.
   - thermomixer at 800 rpm or nutator.

7. Spin-elute through a Spin-X column or similar to
   remove gel slices

   - 4 min at 7000 rpm

8. Purify using Zymo Clean & Concentrator-5 kit
   (R1015) [2,3]:

   - Perform all spin steps at 16000g.
   - Add 800.0 µL RNA binding buffer to the crude
     RNA.
   - Add 1200.0 µL 95-100% ethanol to the crude RNA.
   - Load on a Zymo-Spin IICR column.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.

   - Add 400 µL RNA prep buffer.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.
   - Add 700 µL RNA wash buffer.
   - Spin 30s; discard flow-through.
   - Add 400 µL RNA wash buffer.
   - Spin 1m; discard flow-through.

   - Add 15 µL nuclease-free water.
   - Spin 30s; keep flow-through.

9. Measure yield by NanoDrop
