Reproduce [Reyes2021]_
**********************

My goal for this experiment is to try to establish a positive control by 
following the [Reyes2021]_ protocol as closely as I can.  My linker is 
different, but hopefully that will be the only difference.

Observations:

- I don't see any evidence of mRNA/peptide coupling.

- I also don't see any evidence of FLAG expression.

  In :expt:`117`, I was able to visualize FLAG expression with PUREfrex 1.0 
  using SDS PAGE.  But I used TBE/urea PAGE for this experiment because I 
  didn't want to salt to interfere with the gel.  I thought about using 
  desalting columns, but FLAG is small enough that it'd be retained by the 
  column.
