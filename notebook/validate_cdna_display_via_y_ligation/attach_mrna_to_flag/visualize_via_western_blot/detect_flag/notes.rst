Detect FLAG
***********

After not seeing any binding in :expt:`126`, I need to troubleshoot my Western 
blot protocol before I can move on with optimization etc.  The specific things 
I want to try are:

- Only one condition: maximal antibody, incubation time, etc.
- Include dot blot, to rule out transfer problems.
- Load more FLAG, to rule out sensitivity problems.
- Larger antibody volume

Could try using tricine gels...
