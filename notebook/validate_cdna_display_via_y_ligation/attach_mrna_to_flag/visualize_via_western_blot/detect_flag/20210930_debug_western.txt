 1. Prepare 1 L 1x TBST:
    
    - 100 mL 10x TBS
    - 1 mL Tween-20
    - water to 1 L

 2. Prepare 100 mL blocking buffer [1]:
    
    - 100 mL 1x TBS
    - 5 g nonfat dry milk (5% w/v final)
    - Mix for at least 30 min [2].

 3. Load 10 µL of FLAG-fusion positive control.

 4. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL Chameleon 800
    samples: 10 µL/lane
    run: 165V for 42 min

 5. Transfer proteins to a PVDF membrane via iBlot:
    
    - Place the anode stack (in its plastic tray) in 
      the iBlot machine.
      - Remove any bubbles underneath the membrane.
    
    - Place the gel on the membrane.
      - Rinse the gel with water beforehand.
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Soak included filter paper in water
    - Place filter paper on gel.
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Place the cathode stack on the filter paper 
      (copper side up, agarose side down, discard 
      tray).
      - Remove any bubbles.
    
    - Attach disposable sponge to the lid of the 
      iBlot machine.  Make sure the metal band is in 
      the upper right, aligned with the electrode.
    
    - Run at 20V (P3) for 5-6 min [4].
    
    - Transfer the membrane to water immediately 
      after the run finishes.  If the membrane dries 
      out, re-wet it in methanol and rinse with 
      water before blocking.

 6. Trim off unused parts of the membrane.

 7. Incubate the membrane in 20 mL blocking buffer
    for 1h at room temperature with gentle shaking
    [5].

 8. Prepare the primary antibody:

    - 5 mL TBST
    - 5 mL blocking buffer
    - 10 µL monoclonal mouse anti-DYKDDDDK tag (r4)

 9. Incubate the membrane in the primary antibody
    solution overnight at 4°C, in the dark and with
    gentle shaking [5].

10. Store unused blocking buffer at 4°C overnight
    [5].

11. Wash the membrane as follows [5]:

    - Wash 3x for 5 min in TBST (with shaking)

12. Prepare a 1000x dilution of the secondary
    antibody [5].  Keep the antibody in the dark as
    much as possible:

    - 5 mL TBST
    - 5 mL blocking buffer
    - 10 µL goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (r3)

13. Incubate the membrane in the secondary antibody
    solution at room temperature for 1h, with shaking
    [5].

14. Repeat the above washing procedure [5].

15. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    784 nm
    filter:  832BP37

    - Place the membrane in the scanner protein-side
      down.

Notes:
[1] It's important that the blocking buffer *not* 
    contain any detergent.

[2] Undissolved particles within buffers (milk 
    powder in blocking buffer for example) 
    potentially can settle on the membrane and 
    create fluorescent artifacts.  Therefore, we 
    suggest using high quality reagents, allowing 
    suitable time for all components to fully 
    dissolve, and filter sterilize all buffers 
    (KBK: in my hands, milk cannot be sterile 
    filtered).

    Do not touch the membrane or gel with bare or 
    gloved hands. This may contaminate the gel or 
    membrane and interfere with further analysis. 
    If you need to adjust the membrane, always use 
    forceps.

[4] Small proteins <30 kDa migrate more rapidly 
    during electrophoretic separation, and 
    consequently require less time to transfer 
    from the gel matrix to the membrane. If your 
    protein of interest is in this size range, you 
    may need to reduce the Run Time to 5–6 minutes 
    for your transfer.
