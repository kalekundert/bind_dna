- Prepare 100 mL blocking buffer:

  - 100 mL 1x TBS
  - 5 g nonfat dry milk (5% w/v final)

  Mix well and filter [1].

Notes:

[1] Undissolved particles within buffers (milk 
    powder in blocking buffer for example) 
    potentially can settle on the membrane and 
    create fluorescent artifacts.  Therefore, we 
    suggest using high quality reagents, allowing 
    suitable time for all components to fully 
    dissolve, and filter sterilize all buffers.
