- Prepare 50 mL blocking buffer [1]:

  - 5 mL 10x TBS
  - 45 mL water
  - 2.5 g nonfat dry milk (5% w/v final)
  - Mix for at least 30 min [2].

Notes:

[1] It's important that the blocking buffer *not* 
    contain any detergent.

[2] Undissolved particles within buffers (milk 
    powder in blocking buffer for example) 
    potentially can settle on the membrane and 
    create fluorescent artifacts.  Therefore, we 
    suggest using high quality reagents, allowing 
    suitable time for all components to fully 
    dissolve, and filter sterilize all buffers 
    (KBK: in my hands, milk cannot be sterile 
    filtered).
