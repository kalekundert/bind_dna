- Transfer proteins to a PVDF membrane via iBlot:

  - Place the anode stack (in its plastic tray) in 
    the iBlot machine.
    - Remove any bubbles underneath the membrane.

  - Place the gel on the membrane.
    - Rinse the gel with water beforehand.
    - Remove any bubbles.

  - Soak included filter paper in water
  - Place filter paper on gel.
    - Remove any bubbles.

  - Place the cathode stack on the filter paper 
    (copper side up, agarose side down).
    - Remove any bubbles.

  - Attach disposable sponge to the lid of the 
    iBlot machine.

  - Run at 20V for 5-6 min [2].

  - Transfer the membrane to water immediately 
    after the run finishes.  If the membrane dries 
    out, re-wet it in methanol and rinse with 
    water before blocking.

    Do not touch the membrane or gel with bare or 
    gloved hands. This may contaminate the gel or 
    membrane and interfere with further analysis. 
    If you need to adjust the membrane, always use 
    forceps. 

[2] Small proteins <30 kDa migrate more rapidly 
    during electrophoretic separation, and 
    consequently require less time to transfer 
    from the gel matrix to the membrane. If your 
    protein of interest is in this size range, you 
    may need to reduce the Run Time to 5â€“6 minutes 
    for your transfer.
