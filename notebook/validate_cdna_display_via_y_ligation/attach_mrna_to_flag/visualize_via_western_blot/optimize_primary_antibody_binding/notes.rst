*********************************
Optimize primary antibody binding
*********************************

Before doing any experiments on unknown samples, I want to identify good 
parameters for visualizing known samples.  Specifically, I want to optimize the 
concentration and incubation time for the primary antibody.  I'll try the 
following parameters:

Time:

- 1h
- overnight

Concentration:

- 1 µL/mL 
- 0.31 µL/mL
- 0.1 µL/mL
