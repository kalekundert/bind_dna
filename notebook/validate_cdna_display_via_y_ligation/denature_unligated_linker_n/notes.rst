Denature unligated linker-N
***************************
In order to know if the ligation reaction between linker-N and mRNA is working, 
I need a way to completely separate these two oligos if they are not covalently 
attached.  I initially thought that it would be enough to run the samples on a 
denaturing (i.e. urea) gel, but this does not seem to work (see :expt:`10`).  

I found that adding a competing oligo was the most effective way to solve this 
problem: :expt:`50`
