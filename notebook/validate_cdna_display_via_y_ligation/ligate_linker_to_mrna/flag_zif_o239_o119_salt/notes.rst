Flag/Zif, o239/o119, salt

Previously, I found that salt is required for annealing and inhibitory for 
ligation (:expt:`12`).  However, there are reasons to revisit this conclusion:

- [Reyes2021]_ does not include salt, and I'm trying to follow this protocol.

- My methods have improved.  I now:

  - Label the linker with Cy5, to avoid cross-talk with the mRNA signal.

  - Include o194 in the electrophoresis sample buffer, to clearly distinguish 
    annealed from ligated product.

- Linker-N required phosphorylation, while my current linkers do not.  My 
  concerns was about salt interfering with phosphorylation, not ligation 
  (:expt:`59`).
