- Setup alkaline hydrolysis reaction [1]:

  - 60 µL IVTT reaction
  - Add 12 µL 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) [2].
  - Add 12 µL 1M NaOH [3].
  - Incubate at 95°C for 10 min.
  - Quench by adding 24 µL 0.5M HCl.

[2] EDTA (pH) has to be added first to chelate Mg2+, 
    otherwise Mg2+ ions will precipitate in alkalic 
    conditions and entrap DNA in precipitate.  

[3] pH above 11 should denature but not hydrolyze 
    DNA.  This reaction should have pH>13.
