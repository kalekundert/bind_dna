Measure Zif268 binding via [Noyes2008]_
***************************************

My goal here is to simply recapitulate the basic B1H assay using the controls 
from [Noyes2008]_, to make sure the strain and the plasmids work in my hands.  
To that end, I'm planning to individually transform and test target and 
non-target bait plasmids.

.. todo::

   - Make NM plates ([3-AT]: 0, 1, 2, 4 mM)
   - Make chemically competent cells
   - Transform, grow on LB + Kan + Amp
   - Pick colony, grow to ~OD 1
   - Wash
   - Plate dilutions
