Validate exonuclease assay
**************************

I want to show that the nuclease assay works in principle---i.e. that Zif268 
binding can protect the barcode from digestion---and establish some reasonable 
parameters before trying all the combinations of Zif268 mutants, target sites, 
N/C-terminal barcodes, etc. that I have cloned.

Considerations
==============

Capped Ends
-----------
This assay will depend on me being able to block nuclease 
activity---specifically Bal-31 activity---on both ends of a DNA molecule.  This 
ability may not be necessary for the ultimate protection assay, but it may also 
be helpful.  At the very least it would help make good controls.  There are a 
few ways to potentially block BAL-31:

- Mechanism of BAL-31:

   - [Zhou1990]_ argues that BAL-31 acts "through a 3′ → 5′-directed 
     exonuclease activity in conjunction with an endonuclease activity against 
     the 5′-terminated single-stranded tails generated by the exonuclease 
     activity. No evidence for a 5′ → 3′ mode of exonuclease action was seen."

- Use TelN to create linear DNA with covalently capped ends. 
  
   - I don't know for sure that the capped ends will inhibit nuclease activity, 
     but it seems reasonable.

- Phosphorothioate nucleotides (S-oligo):

   - https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/phosphorothioates.html

   - Nucleotides with SPO₃ instead of PO₄ between the sugars in the backbone.

   - These nucleotides are sold by IDT and are considered to resist nuclease 
     degradation.

   - I have not able to find a report of BAL-31 specifically being inhibited by 
     S-oligos.
     
   - Given that BAL-31 is believed to begin by acting as a 3' exonuclease, it 
     is probably necessary to have 3' S-oligos.  Unfortunately, Using these 
     oligos for PCR would give 5' S-oligos...

   - [Crinelli2002]_ "However, largely because of their polyanionic nature, 
     phosphorothioates cause non-specific protein binding, with consequent 
     sequence-independent effects that limit many applications [13-15].

- Locked nucleic acids (LNAs):

   - Similar conceptually to S-oligos.

   - [Crinelli2002]_ tests BAL-31 specifically.  Strangely, both terminal and 
     internal LNAs are needed to confer substantial resistance to BAL-31.  This 
     makes me not confident that I'll be able to get this to work robustly for 
     me.

- Cross-linking

   - Psoralen-induced crosslinks are known to inhibit BAL-31 [Putney1981]_.

   Note that I enhanced the contrast of the lanes with DNA.

EcoRV & BAL-31 --- 2019/12/11
-----------------------------
.. protocol::

   - Digest plasmid with EcoRV: See binder, 11/1/19


To-do
=====
- Repeat TelN digestion to confirm that it doesn't offer protection.

- Prepare EcoRV digested p59, to optimize time of nuclease treatment (75 nM 
  DNA).
