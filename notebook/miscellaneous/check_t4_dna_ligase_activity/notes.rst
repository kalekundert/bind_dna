Check T4 DNA ligase activity
****************************

I've been having trouble with my cloning reactions recently, so I wanted to 
check whether or not my ligase was compromised.  I found a simple assay 
described by Thermo based on the ligation of HindIII-digested lambda DNA:

Observations:

- The ligase is clearly active.  In fact, my results look very similar to the 
  example results shown in the Thermo PDF.
