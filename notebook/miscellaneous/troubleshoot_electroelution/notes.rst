Troubleshoot electroelution
***************************

The first two times I tried to gel purify my DNA by electroelution, I got no 
yield.  Here I want to systematically figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Below is a list of potential mistakes I may have made.  Some of these are taken 
from the troubleshooting guide that came with the kit:

- Placing the capsule either on an absorbent surface or in a puddle: I used a 
  towel to wipe down the outside of the capsule, but maybe I was too aggressive 
  with that.

- DNA is not long enough: The protocol claims that fragments with MW >4000 will 
  be recovered with 80-90% efficiency.  That MW corresponds to ≈10 bp of dsDNA.  
  f186 is 2.4 kb, so this should not be an issue at all.  (Note that I was 
  initially worried about this because I read MW >4000 as length >4000 bp.)

- Not enough DNA: The protocol claims 80-90% recovery with 2 µg of input DNA.  
  I've been using a bit less than 1 µg.  That shouldn't be a significant 
  difference, but using more DNA might make it easier to see tell if I get 
  *any* yield.

- Didn't remove the free buffer from the capsule right.  I don't really know 
  what I could've done wrong, but this just seems like the most fragile step of 
  the protocol.  It's worth noting that the p1000 tip doesn't fit all the way 
  in the capsule, so I had to use a p200 tip to get all of it.

What's the best way to practice this:

- Digest a bigger quantity of DNA, then run multiple lanes.

  - Maybe three lanes?

  - At some point I'll run out, and have to miniprep more.  I could just bite 
    the bullet and do that now, though...

  - I think this is the best thing to do, right now.

- Try recovering ladder bands

  - The things is that I don't know how much DNA is in those bands, so I 
    wouldn't be able to calculate an efficiency.

- Find a DNA standard

  - I've looked before and not found anything.
