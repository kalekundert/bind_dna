Troubleshoot miniprep yields
****************************

While trying to gel purify a fragment from digesting a plasmid (:expt:`190`), I 
noticed that my starting concentration of DNA was very low.  This led me to 
notice that my Nanodrop measurements had very high 260/280 ratios, suggesting 
RNA contamination.  Here I try to work out what the problem is.

=======
- I've been pretty consistently getting 80-100 ng/µL for pUC19.  The yields for 
  p236 have been lower, but those were also earlier experiments, where I wasn't 
  being as quantitative.

  - :expt:`190` (p236): 10, 20, 50 ng/µL
  - :expt:`190` (p2): 100 ng/µL
  - :expt:`191` (p2): 80-100 ng/µL
  - :expt:`193` (p2): 70-80 ng/µL
  - :expt:`195` (p2): 90-100 ng/µL

  100 ng/µL is good enough to move forward with, but the Nanodrop measurements 
  for these samples are ≈300 ng/µL with high 260/280 ratios, suggesting that 
  there is still RNA contamination.

I'm not sure what to do.  There seems to be a problem with RNA contamination, 
but nothing I do has any effect on it.  If I can get 100 ng/µL consistently, 
that's probably good enough.  I'm not totally sure if I can, but I guess the 
only way to know if to try.  Once I get the qubit reagents, maybe I can make 
some more measurements.

The NEB kit (from :expt:`191`) was promising.  The yield was low and the 
260/280 ratio wasn't great, but the Nanodrop and the gel agreed on 
concentration (and I only used 1.5 mL of cells—the Qiagen kit had comparable 
yields with the reduced volume of cells).  Maybe the kit really is the issue.
