Compare miniprep strains/media
******************************

In :expt:`191`, I got similar results with a number of different miniprep kits, 
suggesting that the miniprep procedure itself is not the reason for my low 
yields.  Here I want to compare different competent cell strains and growth 
media.

- The growth media doesn't seem to make a difference.

- Tina's strain consistently yields much more than mine.  Judging by the 
  260/280 ratios, the product is also cleaner with that strain.  This could be 
  because of the plasmid and/or the strain itself.
