1. Setup 2 restriction digestions [1,2]:

   Reagent               Stock    Volume      2.2x
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                         3.00 µL   6.60 µL
   p236              200 ng/µL   5.00 µL  11.00 µL
   rCutSmart Buffer        10x   1.00 µL   2.20 µL
   NotI-HF             20 U/µL   0.50 µL   1.10 µL
   HindIII-HF          20 U/µL   0.50 µL   1.10 µL

                                10.00 µL  10.00 µL/rxn

2. Incubate at the following temperatures [3]:

   - 37°C for 5–15 min
   - 80°C for 20 min

3. Label the product: f186

4. Prepare 1 sample for electrophoresis:

   Reagent      Stock    Volume
   ────────────────────────────
   f186                10.00 µL
   loading dye     6x   2.00 µL
   ────────────────────────────
                       12.00 µL

5. Run a gel:

   gel: 0.5% agarose
   buffer: 0.5x tris-acetate
   ladder: 5 µL 1kb+ DNA ladder
   samples: 12 µL/lane
   run: 100V for 40 min

6. Stain gel with GelGreen [4-6]:

   - Keep the stain protected from light.

   - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 3x GelGreen, 100 mM NaCl.
   - Shake gently for 30m.

7. Purify the desired band using the freeze-and- 
   squeeze method [7]:
   
   - Cut the desired band out of the gel.
   
   - Equilibrate gel slice in 2x PBS [8] for 30 min 
     at room temperature, in the dark.  Use at least 
     10x the volume of the gel slice.
   
   - Transfer gel slice to clean tube.
   
   - Flash-freeze with liquid nitrogen.
   
   - Immediately move the gel into a Spin-X column 
     and centrifuge for 10 min at max speed 
     (≈21,000g) [9].
   
   - Measure DNA recovery by Nanodrop.
   
   - Desalt and concentrate using a silica spin 
     column.

8. Purify the desired band by electroelution:
   
   - Make a slice in the gel just downstream of the desired band.
   
   - Insert 1-2 pieces of 3MM Whatman paper into the slice (depending on the 
     breadth of the band).
   
   - Continue electrophoresis for ≈2 min.
   
   - Incubate filter paper with 50-100 µL EB in a 500 µL tube.
   
   - Repeat the above step once.
   
   - Lyophilize to concentrate the DNA.

[2] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA
    (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume
    should not exceed 10% of the total reaction
    volume to prevent star activity due to excess
    glycerol.

[3] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if
    the DNA will be purified before use.

[5] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

[6] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.

[8] Neutral pH and high salt (300 mM) are both 
    somewhat important.  Sodium acetate (NaAc) is 
    slightly better than sodium chloride (NaCl), 
    but I only have NaAc with pH=5.2, while my PBS 
    is pH=7.4.

[9] Using a filter is not necessary, but improves 
    yields by 10-20%.
