 1. Setup 1 restriction digestion [1,2]:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    p236              20 ng/µL  45.00 µL
    rCutSmart Buffer       10x   5.10 µL
    NotI-HF            20 U/µL   0.45 µL
    HindIII-HF         20 U/µL   0.45 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                51.00 µL

 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [3]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 80°C for 20 min

 3. Label the product: f186

 4. Prepare 3 samples for electrophoresis:

    Reagent      Stock    Volume      4.5x
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    f186                15.00 µL  67.50 µL
    loading dye     6x   2.00 µL   9.00 µL
    ──────────────────────────────────────
                        17.00 µL  17.00 µL/rxn

 5. Run a gel:

    gel: 0.5% agarose
    buffer: 0.5x tris-acetate
    ladder: 5 µL 1kb+ DNA ladder
    samples: 18 µL/lane
    run: 100V for 40 min

 6. Stain gel with GelGreen [4-6]:

    - Keep the stain protected from light.

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 3x GelGreen, 100 mM
      NaCl.
    - Shake gently for 30m.

 7. Purify the desired band using the freeze-and-
    squeeze method [7]:

    - Cut the 2.4kb band out of the gel.
    - Equilibrate gel slice in 2x PBS [8] for 30 min
      at room temperature, in the dark.  Use at least
      10x the volume of the gel slice.
    - Transfer the gel slice to a clean tube.  If you
      put a small piece of plastic wrap underneath
      the gel slice, it will be easier to remove.
    - Flash-freeze with liquid nitrogen.
    - Immediately move the gel into a Spin-X column
      and centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000g [9].
    - Measure DNA recovery by Nanodrop.
    - Desalt and concentrate using a silica spin
      column.

 8. Purify the desired band by electroelution:
    
    - Make a slice in the gel just downstream of the desired band.
    
    - Insert 1-2 pieces of 3MM Whatman paper into the slice (depending on the 
      breadth of the band).
    
    - Continue electrophoresis for ≈2 min.
    
    - Incubate filter paper with 50-100 µL EB in a 500 µL tube.
    
    - Repeat the above step once.
    
    - Lyophilize to concentrate the DNA.

 9. Purify the desired band using the Qiagen QIAEX II
    gel extraction kit.

10. Measure yields by Nanodrop and by 1% E-Gel EX.

[2] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA
    (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume
    should not exceed 10% of the total reaction
    volume to prevent star activity due to excess
    glycerol.

[3] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if
    the DNA will be purified before use.

[5] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

[6] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.

[8] Neutral pH and high salt (300 mM) are both
    somewhat important.  Sodium acetate (NaAc) is
    slightly better than sodium chloride (NaCl), but
    I only have NaAc with pH=5.2, while my PBS is
    pH=7.4.

[9] Using a filter is not necessary, but improves
    yields by 10-20%.
