$ sw miniprep_from_plate

1. Miniprep from a lawn:
   
   - Pipet 1 mL water onto the lawn and use a cell 
     spreader to resuspend the cells.  Usually I 
     only recover ≈500 µL.
   
   - Use ≈10¹⁰ cells for the miniprep protocol.
   
     - Qiagen specifically recommends 1-5 mL of 
       culture at a density of 3-4×10⁹ cells/mL.
   
     - I once measured that I recovered 10¹¹ cells 
       from the lawn, so I used 1/10 of the 
       recovered volume (e.g. 50 µL) for the 
       miniprep.
   
   - Miniprep as usual.
