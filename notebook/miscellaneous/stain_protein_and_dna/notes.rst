Stain protein and DNA
*********************

I've had problems staining SDS-PAGE gels to visualize both protein and DNA 
bands.  For example, see :expt:`71`.  This would be very useful to be able to 
do reliably, so I want to spend a little bit of time trying to get it right.

There are a number of things I could try:

- Staining order
- With/without microwaving
- Protein stain: Coomassie, SafeStain, SYPRO Ruby, SYPRO Orange

Maybe the methanol/ethanol in the Coomassie staining solution is causing 
problems.
