Measure Zif268 binding via [Meng2005]_
**************************************

My goal here is to simply recapitulate the basic assay from [Meng2005]_, to 
make sure the strain and the plasmids work in my hands.  To that end, I'm 
planning to individually transform and test target and non-target bait 
plasmids.


.. todo::

   - Make NM, NM +His −3-AT media plates
   - Make chemically competent cells
   - Transform, grow on LB + Kan + Chlor
   - Pick colony, grow to ~OD 1
   - Wash
   - Plate dilutions on NM, NM +His −3-AT plates.

   Order omega strains
   - Yes, just do it.  I might not need it, but it's cheap and I might want it.
