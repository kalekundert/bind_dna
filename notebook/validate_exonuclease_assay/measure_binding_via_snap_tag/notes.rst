Measure binding via SNAP tag
****************************

2021/10/14:

Given the difficulty of getting the HUH-tagged Zif268 to work, I thought 
briefly about whether it'd be worth using SNAP-tag instead.  

I found that Biosynthesis offers the SNAP reagent (benzylguanine) as an 
oligonucleotide modification.  (IDT does not.)  I requested a quote for a 
simple 20 bp primer with a 5' benzylguanine modification, and the price was 
$1250.  That's far to much for a pilot experiment.

Presumably there's ways to attach the SNAP-tag to an oligo using 
maleimide/click chemistry, but I haven't looked into that.
