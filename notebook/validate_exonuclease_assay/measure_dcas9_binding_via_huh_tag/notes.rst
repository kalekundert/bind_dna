*********************************
Measure dCas9 binding via HUH-tag
*********************************

My goal for this experiment is quickly determine whether my exonuclease assay 
is worth pursuing.  In this case I'll be using dCas9 (rather than Zif268) as a 
DNA-binding protein and a HUH-tag (rather than cDNA/CIS display) to tether the 
protein to its target.  These components are relatively easy to prepare and 
validate, so they provide a good way to test and troubleshoot the exonuclease 
assay while I'm still working on the display techniques.

It's possible that I'll need to do some optimization to see binding, e.g.  
which nuclease, nuclease concentration, reaction time, salt concentration, 
non-specific DNA concentration, whether to use molecular crowding agents, etc.
