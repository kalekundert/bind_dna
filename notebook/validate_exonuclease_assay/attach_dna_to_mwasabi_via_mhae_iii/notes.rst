Attach DNA to mWasabi via M.Hae III
***********************************

One potential way to covalently attach DNA to protein is via the M.Hae III 
methyltransferase.  This enzyme will react irreversibly to substrates with the 
sequence ``GGFC``, where ``F`` is 5-fluorodeoxycytidine.  

This technique is described by [Bertschinger2004]_, where it is used for a form 
of DNA display based on droplets.  So it's somewhat appealing that I could 
potentially use the same approach for DNA display if it works well.  That said, 
even in the paper the reaction only goes to about 50% completion, so I don't 
have too much hope that it'll work well.
