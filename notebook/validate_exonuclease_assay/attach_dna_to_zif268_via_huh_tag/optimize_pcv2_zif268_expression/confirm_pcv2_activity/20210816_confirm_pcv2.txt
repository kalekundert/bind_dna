1. In the following steps, setup these conditions:

   PCV2-Zif268:          +  −  +  +
   DNA + spacer (f134):  −  +  +  +
   EDTA:                 −  −  −  +

2. Prepare 80 µL 5x Zif268 storage buffer + MnCl₂:

   MnCl₂                   1000 mM   2.5 mM    1 µL

3. Prepare the +DNA control:

   - 7 µL water
   - 2 µL 5x Zif268 storage buffer + MnCl₂
   - 1 µL 1314 nM f107

4. Attach DNA to PCV2 [1-3]:

   Reagent                          Stock    Volume        8x
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                                    6.34 µL  50.70 µL
   Zif268 storage buffer + MnCl₂       5x   2.00 µL  16.00 µL
   PCV2-Zif268                      16 µM   0.06 µL   0.50 µL
   EDTA                            500 mM   0.60 µL
   f134                           1000 nM   1.00 µL
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                           10.00 µL   8.40 µL/rxn

   - Add each reagent in order.
   - Mix after adding EDTA (and before adding DNA).
   - Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.

5. Prepare 4 samples for SDS PAGE:

   Reagent                 Stock    Volume        6x
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Bolt LDS sample buffer     4x   3.85 µL  23.10 µL
   Bolt reducing agent       10x   1.54 µL   9.24 µL
   sample                         10.00 µL
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  15.39 µL   5.39 µL/rxn

   - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

6. Run a gel:

   gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
   buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
   ladder: 5 µL SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen LC5925)
   samples: 15.4 µL/lane
   run: 165V for 60 min

7. Stain gel with SYPRO Orange [4-7]:

   - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 1x SYPRO Orange, 7.5%
     acetic acid.
   - Shake gently for 40m.

   - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 7.5% acetic acid.
   - Shake gently for 1m.

8. Image with a laser scanner:

   lasers:    488 nm   658 nm
   filters:  518BP22  710BP40

Notes:
[1] Invitrogen recommends loading no more than 250
    ng/band on Bolt SDS PAGE gels, and the detection
    limit for Coomassie (as an IR dye [Butt2013]) is
    at least 10 ng/band.  That corresponds to a range
    of ≈1.4-0.1 pmol Cas9-PCV2/band (MW: 176.8 kDa).
    I probably want to be on the high end of that.

[2] The EDTA reaction is a negative control
    established in [VegaRocha2007].  They used 2.5 mM
    divalent metal and 30 mM EDTA to prevent
    coupling.

[3] f16 and f12 are 414 bp.  At that length, 50 ng/µL
    (a typical PCR yield) corresponds to ≈150 nM.
    [Lovendahl2017] used a 10:1 DNA:protein ratio to
    maximize the amount of coupled protein.  I'm
    going to use a 1:1 ratio instead, both because I
    don't want a lot of unbound DNA in my qPCR
    reactions and because a 10:1 ratio would use a
    lot of material.

[5] The stain solution may be reused up to four
    times, but sensitivity is dramatically reduced.
    Use fresh stain for optimal sensitivity.

[6] For low percentage gels and for very small
    proteins, 10% acetic acid will result in better
    retention of the protein in the gel without
    compromising sensitivity.  Do not fix the
    proteins with methanol-containing solutions.
    Methanol removes the SDS coat from proteins,
    strongly reducing the signal from SYPRO Orange
    and Red.

[7] Acetic acid will interfere with transfer of the
    proteins to a blot.  You can try diluting SYPRO
    Red or Orange in transfer buffer, but this will
    result in lower sensitivity staining.
    Alternatively, you can stain the gel with SYPRO
    Tangerine (which does not require acetic acid
    fixation) or you can stain the blot directly with
    SYPRO Ruby.
