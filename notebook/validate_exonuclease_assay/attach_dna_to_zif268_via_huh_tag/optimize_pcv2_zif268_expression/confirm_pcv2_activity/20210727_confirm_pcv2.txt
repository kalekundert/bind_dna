                                            10.00 µL   8.66 µL/rxn

    - Add each reagent in order.
    - Mix after adding EDTA (and before adding DNA).
    - Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.

 5. Prepare 4 samples for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                 Stock    Volume        6x

    sample                         10.00 µL
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                   15.39 µL   5.39 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

 6. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen LC5925)
    samples: 15.4 µL/lane
    run: 165V for 60 min

 7. Stain gel with GelGreen [4-6]:

    - Keep the stain protected from light.

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 3x GelGreen, 100 mM
      NaCl.
    - Shake gently for 30m.

 8. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    488 nm
    filter:  518BP22

 9. Stain gel with SYPRO Ruby [7-9]:

    - Repeat 2x:
      - Submerge gel in ≈100 mL fix solution (50%
        methanol, 7% acetic acid).
      - Shake gently for 15m.

    - Submerge gel in ≈60 mL SYPRO Ruby.
    - Microwave for 30s.
    - Shake briefly to evenly distribute heat.
    - Microwave again until almost boiling (≈30s).
    - Shake gently for 5m.
    - Microwave for 30s.
    - Shake gently for 23m.

    - Submerge gel in ≈100 mL wash solution (10%
      methanol, 7% acetic acid).
    - Shake gently for 30m.
    - Rinse 2x for 5 min in ultrapure water.

    laser:    658 nm
    filter:  710BP40

Notes:
[1] Invitrogen recommends loading no more than 250
    ng/band on Bolt SDS PAGE gels, and the detection
    limit for Coomassie (as an IR dye [Butt2013]) is
    at least 10 ng/band.  That corresponds to a range
    of ≈1.4-0.1 pmol Cas9-PCV2/band (MW: 176.8 kDa).
    I probably want to be on the high end of that.

[2] The EDTA reaction is a negative control
    established in [VegaRocha2007].  They used 2.5 mM
    divalent metal and 30 mM EDTA to prevent
    coupling.

[3] f16 and f12 are 414 bp.  At that length, 50 ng/µL
    (a typical PCR yield) corresponds to ≈150 nM.
    [Lovendahl2017] used a 10:1 DNA:protein ratio to
    maximize the amount of coupled protein.  I'm
    going to use a 1:1 ratio instead, both because I
    don't want a lot of unbound DNA in my qPCR
    reactions and because a 10:1 ratio would use a
    lot of material.

[5] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

[6] Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.

[8] The staining protocol is optimized for standard 1
    mm thick, 8 cm × 8 cm SDS-PAGE minigels.  Larger
    or thicker gels require additional volumes of
    reagents and/or longer incubation times.  Use 20
    times the volume of the gel for fix and wash
    solutions, and 10 times the volume of the gel for
    the staining solution.  Microwave times should be
    optimized such that the stain reaches 80–85°C.

[9] Although SYPRO® Ruby stain solution is not
    flammable, use caution when microwaving SYPRO®
    Ruby stain as the solution becomes very hot.
    Placing a lid loosely over the staining container
    will minimize fumes.  Do not heat the fixative
    solution or other methanolic solutions in the
    microwave.
