Confirm PCV2 activity
*********************

Before I can use my PCV2-Zif268 fusion to test the exonuclease binding assay, I 
need to confirm that the PCV2 domain is functional.

Observations:

- I see no evidence of any PCV2 activity.

- Considering my results from :expt:`123`, this probably just means that I 
  didn't add enough protein.  I loaded about 15 pmol of protein in each lane of 
  this experiment, similar to the most dilute lanes in :expt:`123`.  It's 
  interesting that ≈15 pmol of f12 is easily visible with GelGreen, while ≈15 
  pmol of Cy5-labeled DNA is quite faint.

- f12 isn't perfectly clean, but it's pretty good.
