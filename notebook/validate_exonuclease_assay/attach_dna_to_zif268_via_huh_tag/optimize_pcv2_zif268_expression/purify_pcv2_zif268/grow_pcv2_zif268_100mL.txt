- Express PCV2-Zif268 in Lemo21(DE3) cells [1,2]:

  - Start a 5 mL overnight culture of s9 in 
    LB+Carb+Chlor [1].

  - Prepare 100 mL day culture media:

    - 100 mL LB
    - 100 µL 1000x Carb
    - 100 µL 1000x Chlor
    - 20 µL 500 mM L-rhamnose [2]
    - Pre-warm to 37°C

  - Inoculate day culture with 5 mL overnight 
    culture.

  - Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
    OD600=0.6 (30–60 min).

  - Move 5 mL of culture to a separate tube to 
    serve as an uninduced control.  Add 40 µL 1M 
    IPTG [2] to the remaining culture.

  - Continue incubating for 4-5h.

  - Prepare NI/I controls:
    - Pellet 80 µL cells at 15,000g for 1 min.
    - Resuspend in 10 µL lysis buffer with 0.24 U 
      benzonase.
    - Incubate on ice for 15-30 min.
    - Add 10 µL 2x SDS PAGE loading buffer.

  - Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4000g for 
    20 min.  Discard supernatant.

    - Weigh the centrifuge container before adding 
      the cells and after discarding the media, to 
      get the mass of the cell pellet.

  - Flash-freeze and store at −20°C for at least 
    1h, or incubate at −20°C overnight.
