Purify PCV2-Zif268
******************

2021/07/01:

Now that I know that at least some PCV2-Zif268 is solubly expressed, I want to 
try purifying it.  I haven't finished optimizing expression yet, but if my 
yield is good enough, I might not have to.

Planning
========
- Based on the results from :expt:`119`, I'm going to save 10x more of each 
  fraction to run on a gel.

- Only add benzonase to NI/I controls.  Don't want any nuclease in the samples 
  I'm purifying.

- Instead of trying to load the same concentration of sample at each step, I'll 
  just try to load the most sample I can per lane.  I won't be able to compare 
  the intensities of the lanes, but hopefully I'll best be able to see what 's 
  happening at each step.
