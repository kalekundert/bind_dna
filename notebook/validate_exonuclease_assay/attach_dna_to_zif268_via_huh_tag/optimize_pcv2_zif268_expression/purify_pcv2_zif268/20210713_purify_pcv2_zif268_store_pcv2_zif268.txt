 1. Express PCV2-Zif268 in Lemo21(DE3) cells [1,2]:
    
    - Start a 5 mL overnight culture of s9 in 
      LB+Carb+Chlor [1].
    
    - Prepare 100 mL day culture media:
    
      - 100 mL LB
      - 100 µL 1000x Carb
      - 100 µL 1000x Chlor
      - 20 µL 500 mM L-rhamnose [2]
      - Pre-warm to 37°C
    
    - Inoculate day culture with 5 mL overnight 
      culture.
    
    - Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
      OD600=0.6 (30–60 min).
    
    - Move 5 mL of culture to a separate tube to 
      serve as an uninduced control.  Add 40 µL 1M 
      IPTG [2] to the remaining culture.
    
    - Continue incubating for 4-5h.
    
    - Prepare NI/I controls:
      - Pellet 80 µL cells at 15,000g for 1 min.
      - Resuspend in 10 µL lysis buffer with 0.24 U 
        benzonase.
      - Incubate on ice for 15-30 min.
      - Add 10 µL 2x SDS PAGE loading buffer.
    
    - Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4000g for 
      20 min.  Discard supernatant.
    
      - Weigh the centrifuge container before adding 
        the cells and after discarding the media, to 
        get the mass of the cell pellet.
    
    - Flash-freeze and store at −20°C for at least 
      1h, or incubate at −20°C overnight.

 2. Prepare cleared E. coli lysate under native 
    conditions [3]:
    
    - Thaw the pellet on ice for 15 min.
    
      Keep the protein at 4°C for all subsequent 
      steps.  Repeated changes in temperature may be 
      harmful to protein activity and structure [4].
    
    - Resuspend the cell pellet in 2-5 mL lysis 
      buffer per gram wet weight [5,6].
    
    - Add lysozyme to 1 mg/mL.
    
      - Lysozyme is not stable in solution, so 
        prepare a fresh 10x solution of lysozyme in 
        lysis buffer each time.  
    
    - Incubate on ice for 30 min.
    
    - Lyse cells by sonication:
    
      - Keep cells on ice.
      - Repeat 6 times:
        - 10s sonication at 200-300 W
        - 10s cooling period
    
    - If the lysate is very viscous, apply one of 
      the following treatments:
      
      - DNase/RNase [3]:
        - Add RNase A to 10 µg/mL.
        - Add DNase I to 5 µg/mL.
        - Incubate on ice for 10-15 min.
    
      - Benzonase [4]:
        - Add 3U benzonase per mL culture volume.
        - Incubate on ice for 15-30 min.
    
      - Physical [3]:
        - Repeatedly draw sample through a 
          narrow-gauge, blunt-ended needle.
    
    - Centrifuge lysate at 10,000g and 4°C for 20-30 
      min.  Collect supernatant.
      - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: CL

 3. Batch-purify His-tagged proteins under native 
    conditions [7]:
    
    - Add 1 mL 50% Ni-NTA slurry for every 4 mL 
      cleared lysate [7].
    
    - Incubate at 4°C for 1h with gentle shaking 
      (e.g. end-over-end mixing, or orbital mixing 
      at 200 rpm).
    
    - Load the lysate into a column with the bottom 
      outlet capped (e.g. BioRad Poly-Prep or 
      Econo-Pac).
    
    - Remove the bottom cap:
      - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: FT
    
    - Repeat 2x:
      - Wash with 4 mL wash buffer.
      - Save 10 µL for SDS PAGE: W1,W2
    
    - Repeat 4x:
      - Elute with 500 µL elution buffer
      - Collect in separate, clean tubes.
      - Reserve 10 µL for SDS PAGE: E1-E4

 4. Prepare 10 samples for SDS PAGE:

[5] The amount of cells required depends on the 
    expression level of the 6xHis-tagged protein 
    and the expression system used.  The binding 
    capacity of Ni-NTA resins is protein-dependent 
    and normally lies between 5–10 mg/mL.

[6] Lysis buffer contains 10 mM imidazole to 
    minimize binding of untagged, contaminating 
    proteins and increase purity with fewer wash 
    steps.  If the tagged protein does not bind 
    under these conditions, the amount of 
    imidazole should be reduced to 1–5 mM.  With 
    6xHis-tagged proteins exhibiting high binding 
    affinities, the imidazole concentration can be 
    increased to 20 mM.
