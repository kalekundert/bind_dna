*******************************
Optimize PCV2-Zif268 expression
*******************************

Road Map
========
- Confirm that protein is expressed:

  - e.g. plasmid is correct, expression strain is correct, Ni-NTA beads work, 
    etc.
  - Denaturing conditions to see everything
  - No parameter optimization.

- Establish good expression conditions

  - Parameters:

    - Media
    - Expression time/temperature
    - IPTG/rhamnose concentrations

  - Assay:

    - Native purification, because we want soluble protein.
    - Maybe also denaturing conditions, if there's not much soluble protein.

- Native purification vs denaturing purification followed by refolding

  - May be obvious from the expression data.

  - Assays:

    - HUH-tagging
    - EMSA

- Try Zif268-specific purification protocols
  
  - Looks like I can expect to purify from inclusion bodies and refold
  - All protocols I've found so far have been untagged, and have involved 
    several FPLC steps
