 1. Transform p106 and p107 into Lemo21(DE3) cells.

 2. Label the products: s8, s9

 3. In the following steps, setup these conditions:

    PCV2 : dCas9 (p106):   +   +  +   +   +   +   +   +   −   −  −   −   −   −   −   −
    PCV2 : Zif268 (p107):  −   −  −   −   −   −   −   −   +   +  +   +   +   +   +   +
    Fraction:              NI  I  CL  FT  W1  W2  E1  E2  NI  I  CL  FT  W1  W2  E1  E2

    - NI: non-induced
    - I: induced
    - CL: cleared lysate
    - FT: flow-through
    - W1: wash #1
    - W1: wash #2
    - E1: eluate #1
    - E2: eluate #2

 4. Prepare buffer B [1]:
    
    - 100 mM (13.8 g/L) NaH₂PO₄
    - 10 mM (1.2 g/L) Tris Cl
    - 8M (480.5 g/L) urea
    - Adjust pH to 8.0 using NaOH

 5. Prepare buffer C [1]:
    
    - 100 mM (13.8 g/L) NaH₂PO₄
    - 10 mM (1.2 g/L) Tris Cl
    - 8M (480.5 g/L) urea
    - Adjust pH to 6.3 using HCl

 6. Prepare buffer E [1]:
    
    - 100 mM (13.8 g/L) NaH₂PO₄
    - 10 mM (1.2 g/L) Tris Cl
    - 8M (480.5 g/L) urea
    - Adjust pH to 4.5 using HCl

 7. Start 1.5 mL overnight cultures from individual 
    colonies [2,3].

 8. Inoculate 10 mL day cultures with 500 µL 
    overnight culture.

 9. Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
    OD600 is 0.5-0.7 (30 min).

10. Add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM.
    - Pellet 1 mL uninduced cells for SDS PAGE.  
      Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer.
      Freeze until use.

11. Continue incubating for 4-5h.
    - Pellet 1 mL induced cells for SDS PAGE.
      Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer.
      Freeze until use.

12. Purify proteins by "Ni-NTA miniprep" under 
    denaturing conditions [4]:
    
    - Transfer 1 mL of each bacterial culture to a 
      microcentrifuge tube [5].
    
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 1 min.  Discard 
      supernatants [6].
    
    - Resuspend cells in 200 µL buffer B.
    - Vortex gently to lyse cells (avoid frothing).  
      The solutions should become translucent [7].
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10 min.  Discard 
      pellet.
    
    - Add 50 µL of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin [8] 
      to each lysate.
    - Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
    
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
      - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Discard remaining supernatant.
    
    - Repeat 2x:
      - Add 250 µL buffer C.
      - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
      - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Discard remaining supernatant.
    
    - Repeat 3x:
      - Add 25 µL buffer E.
      - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10s.
      - Keep 10 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Collect remaining supernatant.

13. Prepare 16 samples for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                 Stock    Volume       24x
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Bolt LDS sample buffer     4x   3.85 µL  92.40 µL
    Bolt reducing agent       10x   1.54 µL  36.96 µL
    sample                         10.00 µL
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                   15.39 µL   5.39 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

14. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen LC5925)
    samples: 15.39 µL
    run: 165V for 42 min

15. Stain gel with Coomassie [9]:

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 0.1% Coomassie R250, 10%
      acetic acid, 40% methanol.
    - Microwave until almost boiling (≈45s).
    - Shake gently for 5m.
    - Rinse 2x with water.

    - Repeat until the background is clear (2-3x):
      - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 20% methanol, 10%
        acetic acid.
      - Microwave until almost boiling (≈45s).
      - Place a wadded-up kimwipe in the destain
      - Shake gently for 10m.

Notes:
[1] Due to the dissociation of urea, the pH of 
    Buffers B, C, D, and E should be adjusted 
    immediately prior to use.  Do not autoclave.

[5] The amount of culture used depends on the 
    protein expression level.  1 mL is sufficient 
    if the protein is expressed at high rates (see 
    Table 3, page 65). If lower expression rates 
    are expected, larger volumes may be necessary.
    
    If a time course of expression is being 
    performed, take 1 mL samples of a larger 
    culture at 30 min intervals after induction, 
    collect the cell pellets and store them at 
    –20°C until all the samples are ready for 
    processing.

[6] If larger culture volumes are required, refill 
    and re-centrifuge the same tube until all 
    cells are harvested.

[7] Most proteins are soluble in buffer B.  If the 
    solution does not become translucent, lyse 
    cells with buffer A.

[8] 25 µL of Ni-NTA resin has a capacity for 
    125-250 µg His-tagged protein.
