The QIAexpressionist_ recommends testing several different expression media, 
claiming that this often has a noticeable effect on expression.  I'm planning 
to try the following, depending on what's available in lab:

- LB
- 2xYT
- SOB

Note that SOC is SOB + glucose.  The expression strain I'm planning to use--- 
Lemo21(DE3) (NEB C2528)---is supposed to `perform best without glucose 
<https://international.neb.com/protocols/2012/08/24/protein-expression-using-lamo21de3-c2528>`__.  
I'll try using SOC if I can't find any SOB, though.
