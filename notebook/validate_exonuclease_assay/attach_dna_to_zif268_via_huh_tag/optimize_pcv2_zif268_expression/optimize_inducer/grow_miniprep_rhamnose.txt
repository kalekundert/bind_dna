- Start 1.5 mL overnight cultures from individual 
  colonies in LB+Carb+Chlor [1,2].

- Setup 3 day cultures:
  
  - 9.5 mL LB
  - 500 µL overnight culture
  - 0, 2, 5 µL 500 mM rhamnose
    - 0, 100, 250 µM final

- Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
  OD600 is 0.5-0.7 (30 min).

- Add IPTG to a final concentration of 400 µM.
  - Pellet 160 µL uninduced cells for SDS PAGE.  
    Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer [3].

- Continue incubating for 4-5h.
  - Pellet 40 µL induced cells for SDS PAGE.
    Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer [3].

    cause the sample to get really gummy.
