 1. In the following steps, setup these conditions:

    PCV2 : Zif268 (p107):  +   +  +   +   +   +   +   +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +
    Rhamnose [uM]:         0   0  0   0   0   0   0   0   100  100  100  100  100  100  100  100  250  250  250  250  250  250  250  250
    Fraction:              NI  I  CL  FT  W1  W2  E1  E2  NI    I   CL   FT   W1   W2   E1   E2   NI    I   CL   FT   W1   W2   E1   E2

 2. Thaw rhamnose and make 1 mL aliquots.

 3. Start 1.5 mL overnight cultures from individual 
    colonies in LB+Carb+Chlor [1,2].

 4. Setup 3 day cultures:
    
    - 9.5 mL LB
    - 500 µL overnight culture
    - 0, 2, 5 µL 500 mM rhamnose
      - 0, 100, 250 µM final

 5. Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking until 
    OD600 is 0.5-0.7 (30 min).

 6. Add IPTG to a final concentration of 400 µM.
    - Pellet 160 µL uninduced cells for SDS PAGE.  
      Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer [3].

 7. Continue incubating for 4-5h.
    - Pellet 40 µL induced cells for SDS PAGE.
      Resuspend in 1x SDS PAGE loading buffer [3].

 8. Purify proteins by "Ni-NTA miniprep" under 
    native conditions [4]:
    
    - Transfer 1 mL of each bacterial culture to a 
      microcentrifuge tube [5].
    
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 1 min.  Discard 
      supernatant [6].
    
    - Resuspend cells in 100 µL NPI-10.
    - Add lysozyme to 1 mg/mL.
    - Incubate on ice for 30 min.
    
    - Vortex gently to lyse cells (avoid frothing). 
    - Centrifuge at 15,000g for 10 min.
      - Discard pellet.
      - Save 4 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
    
    - Add 20 µL of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin to 
      each lysate.
    - Incubate at 4°C for 30 min.
    
    - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
      - Keep 4.83 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Discard remaining supernatant.
    
    - Repeat 2x:
      - Add 100 µL NPI-20.
      - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
      - Keep 4.35,4.55 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Discard remaining supernatant.
    
    - Repeat 3x:
      - Add 20 µL NPI-500.
      - Centrifuge at 1000g for 10s.
      - Keep 0.95,1.00 µL supernatant for SDS PAGE.
      - Collect remaining supernatant.

 9. Prepare 32 samples for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                     Stock    Volume        48x
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                               4.00 µL  192.00 µL
    Bolt LDS sample buffer         4x   2.50 µL  120.00 µL
    Bolt reducing agent           10x   1.00 µL   48.00 µL
    sample                  100 ng/µL   2.50 µL
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                       10.00 µL    7.50 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

10. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen LC5925)
    samples: 10 µL/lane
    run: 165V for 42 min

11. Stain gel with Coomassie [7]:

    - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 0.1% Coomassie R250, 10%
      acetic acid, 40% methanol.
    - Microwave until almost boiling (≈45s).
    - Shake gently for 5m.
    - Rinse 2x with water.

    - Repeat until the background is clear (2-3x):
      - Submerge gel in ≈30 mL 20% methanol, 10%
        acetic acid.
      - Microwave until almost boiling (≈45s).
      - Place a wadded-up kimwipe in the destain
      - Shake gently for 10m.

[3] Don't freeze; I think that freezing might 
    cause the sample to get really gummy.

    proteins from E. coli under native conditions.

[5] The amount of culture used depends on the 
    protein expression level.  1 mL is sufficient 
    if the protein is expressed at high rates (see 
    Table 3, page 65). If lower expression rates 
    are expected, larger volumes may be necessary.
    
    If a time course of expression is being 
    performed, take 1 mL samples of a larger 
    culture at 30 min intervals after induction, 
    collect the cell pellets and store them at 
    –20°C until all the samples are ready for 
    processing.

[6] If larger culture volumes are required, refill 
    and re-centrifuge the same tube until all 
    cells are harvested.
