 1. Transform 0.5 µL p107 (124 ng/µL) with 10 µL
    MACH1 cells.

 2. Miniprep directly from the resulting lawn.  Elute
    in 200 µL water.

 3. Purify DNA via phenol-chloroform extraction:
    
    - Dilute or divide your sample as necessary to 
      ensure that each tube has between 100-700 µL [1].
    
    - Repeat twice:
    
      - Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
        alcohol (pH≈8 for DNA) to the tube.
    
      - Vortex vigorously to mix the phases.
       
      - Spin in a microfuge at top speed for 1-2 min to 
        separate the phases.
       
      - Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new tube, 
        being careful not to transfer any of the protein 
        at the phase interface.
     
    - Extract the sample with an equal volume of 
      chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove the phenol.

 4. Concentrate the sample(s) to 100 nM (408.9 ng/µL)
    by lyophilization.

 5. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 6. In the following steps, setup these conditions:

    DNA template (p107) [nM]:  100  46  22  10  5  2  1  0

 7. Perform a serial dilution [2]:

    - Put 4.85 μL 100 nM p107 in a tube.
    - Put 2.60 μL nuclease-free water in 7 adjacent
      tubes.
    - Transfer 2.25 μL between each tube *except the
      last* to make 7 2.2-fold dilutions.

 8. Setup 8 PURExpress (NEB E6800) reactions [3]:

    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                             0.40 µL   3.52 µL

    solution B                        1.50 µL  13.20 µL
    RNase inhibitor, murine  40 U/µL  0.10 µL   0.88 µL

                                      5.00 µL   4.00 µL/rxn

    - Thaw all components on ice.
    - Mix A well; certain components may precipitate
      during storage.
    - Mix B gently; do not vortex.
    - Add A before B.

 9. Incubate at 37°C for 2h.

10. Prepare 8 samples for SDS PAGE:

    Reagent                 Stock    Volume       12x
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    water                           4.00 µL  48.00 µL
    Bolt LDS sample buffer     4x   2.50 µL  30.00 µL
    Bolt reducing agent       10x   1.00 µL  12.00 µL
    sample                          2.50 µL
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                   10.00 µL   7.50 µL/rxn

    - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

11. Run a gel:

    gel: 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE
    buffer: Bolt MES SDS running buffer
    ladder: 5 µL PageRuler unstained protein ladder
    samples: 10 µL/lane
    run: 165V for 42 min

12. Stain gel with SYPRO Orange [4-7]:

    - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 1x SYPRO Orange, 7.5%
      acetic acid.
    - Shake gently for 40m.

    - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 7.5% acetic acid.
    - Shake gently for 1m.

13. Image with a laser scanner:

    laser:    488 nm
    filter:  518BP22

Notes:
[1] It is difficult to do the extraction with volumes 
    smaller than 100 µL. The sample can be 
    concentrated again after precipitation.

[2] The final concentrations will be:
    1  1.000000e+02 nM
    2  4.641589e+01 nM
    3  2.154435e+01 nM
    4  1.000000e+01 nM
    5  4.641589e+00 nM
    6  2.154435e+00 nM
    7  1.000000e+00 nM
    8  0.000000e+00 nM

[5] The stain solution may be reused up to four
    times, but sensitivity is dramatically reduced.
    Use fresh stain for optimal sensitivity.

[6] For low percentage gels and for very small
    proteins, 10% acetic acid will result in better
    retention of the protein in the gel without
    compromising sensitivity.  Do not fix the
    proteins with methanol-containing solutions.
    Methanol removes the SDS coat from proteins,
    strongly reducing the signal from SYPRO Orange
    and Red.

[7] Acetic acid will interfere with transfer of the
    proteins to a blot.  You can try diluting SYPRO
    Red or Orange in transfer buffer, but this will
    result in lower sensitivity staining.
    Alternatively, you can stain the gel with SYPRO
    Tangerine (which does not require acetic acid
    fixation) or you can stain the blot directly with
    SYPRO Ruby.
