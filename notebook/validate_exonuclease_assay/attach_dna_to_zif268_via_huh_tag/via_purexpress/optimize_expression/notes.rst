Optimize expression
*******************

Before doing experiments with in vitro-expressed PCV2-Zif268, it would be 
prudent to determine how much template is required for optimal expression.

Observations:

- I don't observe any protein expression.

- It's possible that the protein is under one of the PURExpress bands.  If so, 
  I might be able to visualize it with FluoroTect.

- I wonder if my PURExpress has just gone bad...
