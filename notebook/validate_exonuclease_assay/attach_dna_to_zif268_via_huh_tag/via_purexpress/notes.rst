Having gotten ambiguous results regarding the functionality of the PCV2-Zif268 
fusions, I thought it might be worth trying to express the proteins in vitro.  
This will eliminate the possibility of the proteins losing activity in storage.

One difficulty is that I won't know how much protein I have, but it may not 
matter as long as I can confirm that all of the DNA is reacted.
