*********************************
Attach DNA to mWasabi via HUH-tag
*********************************

2020/11/06

I haven't been able to successfully attach DNA to dCas9, and the results I've 
gotten have been confusing (:expt:`46`, :expt:`68`, :expt:`72`).  One thing I 
can think to try is to purify my own HUH-tagged protein, so see if there's 
maybe a problem with the protein itself.

I'd like to try using mWasabi, since it would make it easy to see whether the 
attachment is working.  Ultimately, though, I'd need to get this working with a 
DNA-binding protein.  I'm not really convinced that a detour with mWasabi would 
be a good use of time.
