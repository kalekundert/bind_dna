1. In the following steps, setup these reactions:

   Buffer:      Mn  Mn  Mn  Mn  Mn  Mn  Mg  Mg  Mg  Mg  Mg  Mg  
   dCas9:       +   −   +   −   +   +   +   −   +   −   +   +
   DNA:         −   +   +   +   +   +   −   +   +   +   +   +
   HUH-target:  −   −   −   +   +   +   −   −   −   +   +   +
   EDTA:        −   −   −   −   −   +   −   −   −   −   −   +

2. Attach DNA to HUH-tagged [1-3]:

   Reagent            Stock    Volume       11x
   ────────────────────────────────────────────
   water                      7.07 µL  77.74 µL
   Mn²⁺/Mg²⁺ buffer     10x   1.00 µL  11.00 µL
   dCas9-PCV2         22 µM   0.05 µL   0.50 µL
   EDTA              500 mM   0.60 µL
   f99,f100          777 nM   1.29 µL
   ────────────────────────────────────────────
                             10.00 µL   8.11 µL/rxn

   - Add each reagent in order.
   - Mix after adding EDTA (and before adding DNA).
   - Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.

3. Prepare samples for SDS PAGE:

   Reagent                 Stock    Volume      7.5x
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Bolt LDS sample buffer     4x   3.85 µL  28.88 µL
   Bolt reducing agent       10x   1.54 µL  11.55 µL
   sample                         10.00 µL
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  15.39 µL   5.39 µL/rxn

   - Incubate at 70°C for 10 min.

4. Run a gel:

   - Use a 4−12% SDS PAGE gel.
   - Load 15.39 µL of each sample.
   - Run at 165V for 42 min.

5. Stain gel with GelGreen:

   - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 3x GelGreen [4].
   - Shake gently for 30 min.

6. Image with a laser scanner:

   laser:   488 nm
   filter:  518BP22

7. Stain gel with SimplyBlue SafeStain:

   - Repeat 3 times:
       - Add 100 mL water.
       - Microwave until almost boiling (1 min).
       - Shake gently for 1 min, then discard water.
   - Add enough stain to cover the gel.
   - Microwave until almost boiling (45-60s).
   - Shake gently for 5 min [5].
   - Wash the gel with 100 mL water for 10 min [6].
   - Add 20 mL 20% NaCl and wash for 5 min [7].

8. Image with a laser scanner:

   laser:   658 nm
   filter:  710BP40

Notes:
[1] Invitrogen recommends loading no more than 250 
    ng/band on Bolt SDS PAGE gels, and the detection 
    limit for Coomassie (as an IR dye [Butt2013]) is 
    at least 10 ng/band.  That corresponds to a range 
    of ≈1.4-0.1 pmol Cas9-PCV2/band (MW: 176.8 kDa).  
    I probably want to be on the high end of that.

[2] The EDTA reaction is a negative control 
    established in [VegaRocha2007].  They used 2.5 mM 
    divalent metal and 30 mM EDTA to prevent coupling.

[3] f16 and f12 are 414 bp.  At that length, 50 ng/µL 
    (a typical PCR yield) corresponds to ≈150 nM.  
    [Lovendahl2017] used a 10:1 DNA:protein ratio to
    maximize the amount of coupled protein.  I'm going 
    to use a 1:1 ratio instead, both because I don't 
    want a lot of unbound DNA in my qPCR reactions and 
    because a 10:1 ratio would use a lot of material.

[4] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution 
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye 
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

    Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.
