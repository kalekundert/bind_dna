Based on the data from :expt:`72`, I think that the dCas9-Rep fusion is 
degrading over time, and that this has been responsible for most of the 
problems I've been having.  Here I will test that explicitly.

In addition, I will apply the lessons I've learned in the previous experiments 
to try to find conditions that will give a high percentage of modified protein.  
Specifically:

- dCas9-Rep concentration: I will go back to assuming 22 ÂµM, which is what the 
  protein is labeled and about what I measured myself: :expt:`70`.  I thought 
  the concentration might be lower due to the large amount of unreacted dCas9, 
  but now I think that's due to degradation.

- Buffer: I'll continue using the [VegaRocha2007]_ buffer.  The reaction seems 
  capable of going to completion in that buffer, see :expt:`72`.

- ori: I'll go back to using the [Lovendahl2017]_ linker (f12).  I got about 
  the same results with that linker (:expt:`83`) as I did with Jorge's linker 
  (f107, :expt:`72`).  f107 does amplify more cleanly, but f12 has the right 
  sequence for the binding assay, and I haven't been able to clone p176 yet.
