****************************
Try assuming 2 µM dCas9-PCV2
****************************

Based on the apparent excess of DNA in :expt:`68`  and the calculations in 
:expt:`70`, I'm going to try doing the reaction with the assumption that the 
dCas9-PCV2 fusion is not as concentrated as is seems.  Specifically, I'll 
assume it has an actual concentration of 1.84 µM based on the calculations in 
:expt:`68`.
