- Transfer DNA to a membrane [1]:

  - Soak the PAGE gel in transfer buffer [2] for 10 
    min with gentle shaking.

  - Soak a HyBond N+ membrane in transfer buffer [2] 
    for 5 min.

  - Briefly soak a 10 mm tall stack of blotting 
    filter paper in transfer buffer [2].

  - Assemble the transfer sandwich:

    - cathode (âˆ’) plate
    - blotting paper (5 mm, soaked)
    - gel (soaked) [3]
    - membrane (soaked)
    - blotting paper (5 mm, soaked)
    - anode (+) plate

    Gently roll each layer to remove bubbles.

  - Transfer at 10V for 30-60 min.

- Denature and fix DNA [4]:

  - Place the membrane DNA-side-up on 3 sheets of 
    Whatman 3MM paper soaked in 400 mM NaOH.

  - Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.

  - Rinse membrane in 2x SSC.

  - Place membrane on a sheet of Whatman 3MM paper 
    to dry.

  - Expose membrane to short-wave (254 nm) UV light 
    for 30-300 sec [6].

Footnotes:
[1] The lab might have a different protocol 
    established for semi-dry blotting, but this is 
    the one recommended by Thermo for Novex gels:

[2] For Bolt SDS-PAGE gels, use 1x Bolt transfer 
    buffer.  Different kinds of gels will need 
    different transfer buffers.

    Don't soak gel for longer than necessary to 
    minimize diffusion of the DNA.

[3] Do not disturb the gel once it has been placed 
    on the membrane; the DNA begins transferring 
    immediately and moving the gel can cause smears.

[5] The duration of UV exposure should be optimized 
    using dot-blotted dilutions of DNA [3].  An 
    alternative to UV crosslinking is to transfer 
    onto a positively charged nylon membrane using 
    an alkaline (rather than saline) buffer [3].
