- Controls:

  - lysate only
  - pure plasmid
  - 0h reaction
  - 2-4h reaction

  This is kinda a mini-timecourse...
  Maybe I can drop the 0h reaction...

- Run 1% agarose gel.

  - Image to make sure the separation is good.

- Transfer DNA to membrane [1]:

  - Soak gel in 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH for 15-30 min.  
    Rock gently.

  - Soak gel in 3 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris HCl (pH=7) for 
    15-30 min.  Rock gently.

  - Prepare the blot sandwich:

    - weight (e.g. glass plate)
    - stack of paper towels
    - HyBond N+ membrane (nylon)
    - gel
    - soaked filter paper that dips into reservoir
    - support holding sandwich above reservoir
    - reservoir of 20x SSC

  - Allow DNA to transfer for 3-16 h [2].

  - Check that no DNA remains in the gel.

  - Soak membrane in 2x SSC for 10-20 min.

  - Fix the DNA by one of the following methods:

    - Bake at 80°C for 2h in a vacuum oven.

    - UV cross-link, e.g. using Stratalink.

- Block the membrane [3]:

  - Preheat ULTRAhyb-Oligo to 68°C

  - Add enough ULTRAhyb-Oligo to keep the membrane 
    uniformly wet (≈1 mL per 10 cm² membrane).
  - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

  - Add probe to a concentration of 1 nM [4,5].
  - Incubate at 42°C for 14-24 h.

  - Discard probe buffer.
  - Repeat twice:
    - Add 50 mL wash buffer: 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS
    - Incubate at 42°C for 30 min.

- Image with laser scanner.

[2] The minimum time required for complete transfer 
    depends on the size of the fragments and the gel 
    concentration. For example, a period of 3 h is 
    enough to transfer completely all HaeIII 
    fragments of E. coli DNA (mostly <1kb) from 2% 
    agarose gels 3 mm thick. But even after 20 h, 
    transfer of large EcoRI fragments of mouse DNA 
    from 9-mm-thick gels is not complete.

[3] ULTRAhyb-Oligo manual.

    This product is meant for hybridizing DNA probes 
    to RNA, not DNA.  But I think it's better than 
    using either Denhardt's solution (no nucleic acid 
    blocking agents, e.g. ssDNA) or ULTRAhyb (not 
    recommended for oligonucleotide probes).

[5] Make sure that the undiluted probe never touches 
    the membrane directly.  If necessary, pour the 
    blocking solution into a clean tube, add the 
    oligo, mix, then pour back over the membrane.
