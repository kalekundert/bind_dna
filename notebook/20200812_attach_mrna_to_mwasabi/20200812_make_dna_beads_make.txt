 1. Setup 1 XmnI digestion [1]:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    water                        3.50 µL

    CutSmart Buffer        10x   1.00 µL
    XmnI               20 U/µL   0.50 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                10.00 µL

 2. Incubate at the following temperatures [2]:

    - 37°C for 5–15 min
    - 65°C for 20 min

 3. Label the product: f42

 4. Purify DNA using magnetic beads [3].

    - Gently resuspend the bead solution [4].
    - Add 1 volume of bead solution to each sample.
    - Incubate 5 min at room temperature.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min and discard supernatant.
    - Wash twice:
      - Add 200 µL 70% EtOH.
      - Incubate 30 sec at room temperature.
      - Apply to magnet and discard ethanol.
    - Air-dry for 4-5 minutes [5].
    - Add 10 µL of nuclease-free water.
    - Apply magnet for >2 min.
    - Transfer ≈95% of the eluant to a clean tube.

 5. Wipe down your bench and anything you'll touch 
    (pipets, racks, pens, etc.) with RNaseZap.

 6. Setup 1 in vitro transcription reaction [6,7] by 
    mixing the following reagents at room temperature 
    in the order given:

    Reagent              Stock    Volume
    ────────────────────────────────────
    reaction buffer        10x   2.00 µL
    rNTP mix            100 mM   8.00 µL
    HiScribe T7            10x   2.00 µL
    f42              125 ng/µL   8.00 µL
    ────────────────────────────────────
                                20.00 µL

 7. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours [8].

 8. Remove unincorporated ribonucleotides using Zymo 
    RNA Clean & Concentrator 25 spin columns.

 9. Nanodrop to determine the RNA concentration.

10. Dilute (if desired) enough RNA to make several 
    10 μM aliquots and to run a gel.  Keep any left- 
    over RNA undiluted.  Flash-freeze in liquid N₂
    and store at -80°C.

11. Prepare samples for TBE/urea PAGE:

    Reagent            Stock    Volume
    ──────────────────────────────────
    water                      4.00 µL
    sample buffer         2x   5.00 µL
    sample         200 ng/µL   1.00 µL
    ──────────────────────────────────
                              10.00 µL

    - Incubate at 70°C for 3 min.

12. Run a gel:

    - Use a 6% TBE/urea PAGE gel.
    - Load 10 µL of each sample.
    - Run at 180V for 40 min.

13. Stain gel with GelRed:

    - Submerge gel in ≈50 mL 3x GelRed [9].
    - Shake gently for 30 min.

14. Image with a 302 nm UV transilluminator.

15. Label the product: f85

Notes:
[1] NEB recommends 5–10 units of enzyme per µg DNA 
    (10–20 units for genomic DNA).  Enzyme volume 
    should not exceed 10% of the total reaction 
    volume to prevent star activity due to excess 
    glycerol.

[2] The heat inactivation step is not necessary if 
    the DNA will be purified before use.

[3] See "Magnetic Bead DNA Purification" in my Google 
    Drive for more details.

[4] Don't vortex; this damages the beads (somehow).

[5] Be careful not to over-dry the beads.  Over-dried
    beads will appear cracked and will be difficult 
    to resuspend.  If this happens, heat and agitate 
    for 10-15 minutes during elution to help 
    resuspend the beads and release the DNA.  An 
    alternative strategy is to add the eluant after a 
    very short drying step, then leaving the tubes 
    open for 10-15 minutes to allow the ethanol to 
    evaporate.

[7] I've found that T7 kits which have been in the 
    freezer for more than ≈4 weeks seem to produce 
    more degraded RNA.

[8] Use a thermocycler to prevent evaporation.

[9] Including 100 mM NaCl in the staining solution 
    enhances sensitivity, but may promote dye 
    precipitation if the gel stain is reused.

    Staining solution can be reused at least 2-3x.
    Store staining solution at room temperature
    protected from light.
