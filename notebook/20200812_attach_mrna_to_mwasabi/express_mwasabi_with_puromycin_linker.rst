Attach mRNA to mWasabi
**********************
My goal for this experiment is to show that I can use cDNA display to 
covalently link protein to mRNA.  Note that this experiment will not include 
the reverse transcriptions steps of cDNA display.  After doing the expression 
reaction, I'll use SDS-PAGE to test if a covalent link was formed.  I'm using 
mWasabi because it will be easy to unambiguously visualize in the gel.
